Theology sheds light on human reality. 
In other words, theology is not a matter, 

00:04.000 --> 00:13.000
I mean, it's not a matter of politics, 
or society, or anything like that,

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
because it is the study of the mystery of God.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Ultimately, that's it, right? Theos, which means God, 

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
and logia, well, yes, wisdom about God, the mystery of God, 

00:20.000 --> 00:30.000
which is an unfathomable mystery, 
one will only learn something very minimal, yes.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
And there are things that it's better not to question too much 

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
because one won't find humanly speaking answers.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
But yes, through theology, human realities are illuminated. 

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
Those human realities are concrete realities 

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
that one encounters in the community, 

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
whether they are personal or communal within that context, 

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
or whether they are at a much broader level, 
which is a social level.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
So, in that line of thought, I believe that precisely 

01:09.000 --> 01:16.000
Jesus also, his theology was not just to teach the disciples, 

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
you see, God is handsome, God is fat, 
God is skinny, God is cute, 

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
he never taught them that, never.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
The Gospel does not show us that, it does not show us that

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
What does the person of Jesus show us? A constant action, 

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
illuminated from the mystery of God.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
We follow Jesus, not the ideology of Jesus, 

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
we follow Jesus who did a work, a mission 

01:43.000 --> 01:50.000
that connected with the most marginalized of his time, 
children, womens, 

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
he saw social realities, he saw injustice, 
he denounced it and all that.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
So, through that same channel, one also finds answers 

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
so that theology doesn't remain as something distant, 

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
I mean, something elevated, 
something that doesn't have a proper foundation, 

02:05.000 --> 02:15.000
but it helps one to not let it just be a 

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
beautiful study, but to apply it, 

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
to apply it more to the context, 
in this specific case of Jordan.
