00:00.000 --> 00:04.500
During the campaign, there was indeed a lot of sexism,

00:04.500 --> 00:08.500
as if they believed that a woman couldn't handle power,

00:08.500 --> 00:14.500
that she couldn't be a councilwoman,
that maybe it was too much for her to be there.

00:14.500 --> 00:18.000
Even on the candidate list, there were very few women,

00:14.500 --> 00:20.000
so they saw the possibility as very minimal

00:20.000 --> 00:23.500
for a woman to become a councilwoman.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
And at that time, I didn't have a current partner,

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
so one had to demand respect

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
and establish boundaries to prevent others from overstepping them.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
It was like that, the most difficult part, but everything else was fine.

00:45.500 --> 00:50.000
It's like a personal triumph to say,

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
"I'm breaking free from that sexism, I won't take it anymore,"

00:54.500 --> 00:57.000
and I must change the way people think

00:57.500 --> 01:01.500
that it's impossible.

01:01.500 --> 01:07.500
In my personal life, I did experience some setbacks

01:07.500 --> 01:11.500
where I felt I couldn't go on anymore

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
and being a single mother, I had to fight and support my children.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
So that was a... it gave me strength to say,

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
just because I'm a woman doesn't mean I can't do it.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Those things drive you,

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
to grow as a person, as a woman,

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
and to set an example for other women who may feel they can't.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.500
So, one becomes an example that it can be done,

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
that if you want it and work for it, things can be accomplished.
