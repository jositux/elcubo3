00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
My father is the one who has been most involved in politics, always ranks first 

00:12.000 --> 00:20.040
when there are campaigns and he was a councilor for three consecutive terms.

00:20.040 --> 00:25.000
Then he got sick and my mom took the council seat.

00:25.240 --> 00:31.520
And then Juan Pablo's sister, Isabella, who works in the mayor's office,

00:31.520 --> 00:38.360
my father supported her and she also became a councilor, and then

00:38.360 --> 00:41.560
the option arose for the seat to remain within the family.

00:41.360 --> 00:46.000
My father said, "No, I won't run because it requires a lot of time,

00:46.000 --> 00:54.400
and you're younger and have more contact with the people."

00:54.400 --> 01:01.640
So that's when my father said, "You're the one who should run."

01:01.640 --> 01:06.000
Even before my father told me that, I had already enrolled in the party and everything,

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
the people in the community were telling me: "You should run now,

01:11.520 --> 01:14.280
for councilor, we'll support you."

01:14.520 --> 01:18.280
And that's how we registered on a list and started the campaign work.

01:18.280 --> 01:22.960
We achieved victory, which was difficult because we had to

01:22.960 --> 01:31.840
compete with other candidates for the council in this area.

01:31.840 --> 01:37.240
We had to compete for votes, but thanks God, it was a success and I was able to accomplish it.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.240
We had to fight among ourselves

01:40.240 --> 01:46.960
because in this sector there were other councilors

01:46.960 --> 01:52.880
and fight for the votes, but thanks to God, it was a success, I was able to achieve it.
