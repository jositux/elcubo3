00:00.000 --> 00:26.080
When I arrived in Jordan,

00:43.760 --> 00:46.280
There were many feelings inside of me.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.280
It's my first parish, it had been about 80 years since they didn't have a resident priest here...

00:53.280 --> 00:58.280
There are no facilities, let's say, like a market square,

00:58.280 --> 01:01.280
Although it is a municipality, we have a health center, not a hospital.

01:09.280 --> 01:12.280
It is an economically poor parish.

01:16.280 --> 01:19.280
The arrival in Jordan was very difficult.

01:19.280 --> 01:23.280
Adapting in the first few days was very difficult for me, it brought tears.
01:46.280 --> 01:51.280
Here, there is this belief of a curse, many say there is a curse

01:51.280 --> 01:54.280
from a priest who cursed the town.

01:54.280 --> 01:58.280
Well, I'm not apathetic to those things.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.280
But I don't focus on that too much.

02:03.280 --> 02:06.280
In fewer words, one cannot let oneself be deceived

02:06.280 --> 02:11.280
by something that I don't know if it's true or not.

02:12.280 --> 02:15.280
Holy Mary, mother of God,

02:15.280 --> 02:19.280
pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.

02:19.280 --> 02:20.280
Amen.

02:39.280 --> 02:43.280
I visited Jordan in 2014.


02:45.280 --> 02:47.280
In that year, I got to know this town.


02:49.280 --> 02:54.280
And one of the first things they showed us was the cemetery.

03:00.280 --> 03:04.280
When I arrived here and saw the cemetery like this,

03:04.280 --> 03:07.280
the chapel had not collapsed yet.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.280
The tombs are very old.

03:12.280 --> 03:15.280
It already looked bad.

03:15.280 --> 03:16.280
Well.

03:16.280 --> 03:21.280
And that day, we came, looked, and like everyone else,

03:21.280 --> 03:23.280
We walked around and left.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.280
But it raised a question for me.

03:26.280 --> 03:29.280
Why doesn't a priest or an administration

03:29.280 --> 03:33.280
get involved in this before it collapses?

03:36.280 --> 03:43.280
He died in April, on April 9th,

03:43.280 --> 03:48.280
of 1919.

03:50.280 --> 03:53.280
On December 12, 2020,

03:53.280 --> 03:56.280
the bishop called me

03:56.280 --> 03:59.280
and asked me to take over this as a parish.

03:59.280 --> 04:02.280
Take this on.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.280
Take Jordán.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.280
And as soon as he said "Take Jordán,"

04:10.280 --> 04:12.280
I thought,

04:12.280 --> 04:14.280
"oh, the cemetery!"

04:14.280 --> 04:16.280
the parish priest who has to fix it,

04:16.280 --> 04:18.280
maybe it's me.

05:13.280 --> 05:16.280
Honestly, I was very scared.

05:18.280 --> 05:19.280
Some people said,

05:19.280 --> 05:23.280
"That cannot be rebuilt with 500 million pesos."

05:24.280 --> 05:27.280
Some people held raffles

05:28.280 --> 05:33.280
and there were $2,673,000 pesos.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.280
That wasn't enough for anything.


05:37.280 --> 05:40.280
Where will they get resources

05:40.280 --> 05:42.280
for that project?

05:43.280 --> 05:45.280
Where will I get it from?

07:02.280 --> 07:03.280
1 pound of dry rice.

07:03.280 --> 07:04.280
Do you have soup rice?

07:04.280 --> 07:05.280
Yes, sir.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.280
Give me 1 pound of soup rice.

07:07.280 --> 07:10.280
Give me 1 pound of promasa also.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.280
How much is it?

07:27.280 --> 07:29.280
$46,300.

07:51.280 --> 07:54.280
At first, I visited the families I could,

07:54.280 --> 07:56.280
because I haven't visited them all.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.280
Well, excuse me.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Go ahead, Father.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.280
It hasn't been too hard for me,

08:03.280 --> 08:08.280
because I perfectly understand the rural reality.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.280
If it doesn't connect through the spiritual or religious life,

08:12.280 --> 08:15.280
it connects because there's a common issue,

08:16.280 --> 08:17.280
which is rural life.

08:23.280 --> 08:24.280
To sit perhaps on the old stool they have,

08:25.280 --> 08:30.280
Have your cup of black coffee that they offer or your glass of lemonade in a glass that might have a crack.

08:32.280 --> 08:36.280
And that gesture of arriving at a house and greeting them.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.280
My potato.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.280
My pea.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.280
They didn't have coffins,

09:02.280 --> 09:06.280
so the next day someone comes and takes them and wrap them up in

09:06.280 --> 09:08.280
plastic or something like that.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.280
And they threw it 

09:10.280 --> 09:11.280
Really?

09:11.280 --> 09:12.280
Yes.

09:12.280 --> 09:13.280
Yes, that's how the morgue was.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.280
It's very sad.

09:17.280 --> 09:21.280
I mean, now it's the second version I hear of that,

09:21.280 --> 09:23.280
because Manuel, well,

09:23.280 --> 09:26.280
Manuel, who owns the farm there,

09:26.280 --> 09:28.280
where the cemetery is now:

09:28.280 --> 09:31.280
Manuelito Sarmiento once told me,

09:31.280 --> 09:33.280
"here,

09:33.280 --> 09:36.280
they left the dead there for three, four days,

09:36.280 --> 09:37.280
sometimes even more."

09:37.280 --> 09:38.280
Yes, that's not a lie.

09:38.280 --> 09:40.280
But then I, well,

09:40.280 --> 09:43.280
I thought to myself, I should ask

09:43.280 --> 09:45.280
why now you're telling me,

09:45.280 --> 09:48.280
was there a communal coffin there?


09:48.280 --> 09:50.280
Yes, that coffin, I don't know where they took it,

09:50.280 --> 09:53.280
well, they did take it.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.280
I want to know,

10:00.280 --> 10:04.280
do you remember where your parents were buried?

10:04.280 --> 10:08.280
over there, look, let´s walk and I'll show you where

10:09.280 --> 10:11.280
It doesn't have a name anymore.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.280
Yes.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.280
You can still see something on this side.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.280
Yes.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.280
Because he told me that

10:22.280 --> 10:25.280
my mom had to be buried

10:25.280 --> 10:27.280
next to him.

10:28.280 --> 10:32.280 
For example, this one, that one, 

10:32.280 --> 10:34.280
that one down there,   

10:34.280 --> 10:37.280
do those graves remain?

10:37.280 --> 10:38.280
Yes.

10:38.280 --> 10:41.280
Because that is, I mean, for history,

10:43.280 --> 10:46.280
how they used to build a tomb before,

10:43.280 --> 10:46.280
how they made them, right?



10:48.280 --> 10:51.280
What model did they use?

10:51.280 --> 10:52.280
Yes.


10:57.280 --> 11:01.280
Those are the goats that I have.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.280
I'll donate whichever one you choose

11:04.280 --> 11:05.280
for the raffle.

11:06.280 --> 11:09.280
I would recommend you choose

11:10.280 --> 11:12.280
that one there, the bigger one.

11:13.280 --> 11:15.280
And I'll donate it, Father.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.280
Alright, thank you very much, Mrs. Magaly.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.280
So, how much would we estimate

11:19.280 --> 11:21.280
the value of that goat?

11:21.280 --> 11:22.280
300 thousand pesos, Father.

11:22.280 --> 11:23.280
300 thousand pesos, alright.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.280
So, it's to let people know

11:25.280 --> 11:27.280
"you won the goat or if you don't want the goat,

11:27.280 --> 11:29.280
you win 300 thousand pesos in cash."

11:33.280 --> 11:35.280
When will you come by Jordan?

11:38.280 --> 11:40.280
I just felt like calling you,

11:40.280 --> 11:42.280
to greet you.

11:45.280 --> 11:46.280
And what?

11:46.280 --> 11:49.280
And what? And your parish? The Maria Auxiliadora?

11:52.280 --> 11:53.280
Come.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.280
Come, let's talk one day, Wednesday.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.280
Wednesday and Thursday.

11:58.280 --> 11:59.280
Yes.

12:01.280 --> 12:02.280
Sometimes I feel bored here

12:02.280 --> 12:04.280
like something dull, damn it.

12:05.280 --> 12:06.280
That's why sometimes, you know...

12:06.280 --> 12:08.280
Well, I don't know.

12:08.280 --> 12:11.280
Sometimes one has moments of joy,

12:11.280 --> 12:12.280
but also sometimes moments

12:12.280 --> 12:14.280
of sadness, of nonsense,

12:14.280 --> 12:15.280
because one...

12:15.280 --> 12:16.280
Well, I don't know.

12:16.280 --> 12:18.280
In this mess, one feels alone.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.280
Sometimes, you know?

12:19.280 --> 12:20.280
But...

12:22.280 --> 12:23.280
Yes.


12:23.280 --> 12:25.280
And sometimes I'm afraid to say

12:25.280 --> 12:26.280
like...

12:26.280 --> 12:28.280
Change, because when I asked for change

12:28.280 --> 12:29.280
in Charalá, look...

12:35.280 --> 12:38.280
Jordán, it's been tough for me,

12:38.280 --> 12:40.280
but I love Jordán.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.280
I love it very much.

12:50.280 --> 12:52.280
And that's why I've made an effort,

12:52.280 --> 12:54.280
That's why I've burned the midnight oil.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.280
And that's why I ask my God

13:06.280 --> 13:08.280
that while I'm here,

13:08.280 --> 13:09.280
he gives me good health

13:09.280 --> 13:11.280
to keep working.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.280
Because I feel

13:17.280 --> 13:20.280
that this is an unexplored matter.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.280
There, there.

13:40.280 --> 13:43.28
Don’t you have a nail?

13:44.280 --> 13:45.280
Don't throw away the nail

13:46.280 --> 13:47.280
because otherwise, you won’t be able to….

13:48.280 --> 13:49.280
Don’t you have a nail?

13:49.280 --> 13:50.280
Yes, yes- Father.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.280
Yes, that. Otherwise, you can't break it there

13:52.280 --> 13:53.280
because you have to make a small cut there with that one.


14:15.280 --> 14:17.280
...We invite you to enjoy

14:17.280 --> 14:19.280
a delicious "mute".

14:19.280 --> 14:20.280
Grilled meat,

14:20.280 --> 14:21.280
empanadas,

14:21.280 --> 14:22.280
verdines (dish made with beans),

14:22.280 --> 14:23.280
beers

14:23.280 --> 14:24.280
and soda.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.280
The funds raised

14:25.280 --> 14:26.280
will go towards

14:26.280 --> 14:29.280
the construction of the cemetery vault.

14:38.280 --> 14:39.280
I

14:39.280 --> 14:42.280
am not a big fan of parties.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.280
First of all, if I,

14:44.280 --> 14:47.280
if I were to say, if one day I could

14:47.280 --> 14:49.280
raise resources in another way,

14:49.280 --> 14:50.280
I would do it.

15:16.280 --> 15:18.280
What I'm doing here is crazy.

15:18.280 --> 15:21.280
Maybe this isn't so religious.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.280
Maybe this isn't so spiritual.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.280
Why did I get myself into this?

15:38.280 --> 15:39.280
Give me more, give me more.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.280
What’s up, Father?

16:23.280 --> 16:24.280
Good! Just working around here

16:24.280 --> 16:25.280
Great.

16:25.280 --> 16:26.280
God bless you. May He protect you from all evi.

16:27.280 --> 16:29.280
Well, thank you very much.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.280
Good.


16:32.280 --> 16:33.280
Good luck father.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.280
Likewise.

16:38.280 --> 16:39.820
Good afternoon.

16:39.820 --> 16:42.160
We offer you the chicken raffle.

16:42.200 --> 16:51.580
$3000 per ticket, two for $5000, so...

16:52.580 --> 16:54.580
Yes, and put them here.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.280
Hello, hello.

17:01.700 --> 17:03.280
Well, good morning.

17:03.280 --> 17:09.280
We welcome each and every one of you to this celebration

17:09.280 --> 17:13.280
of the patron saint festival of Santa Rosa de Lima.

17:21.280 --> 17:26.280
I want to request a big round of applause for our parish priest,

17:26.280 --> 17:28.280
a big round of applause that can be heard over there,

17:28.280 --> 17:33.280
for putting in the effort for this activity.

17:33.280 --> 17:35.280
Father, congratulations.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.280
And on behalf of the community,

17:37.280 --> 17:40.280
we also place you in the hands of Almighty God

17:40.280 --> 17:44.280
so that you may continue with this important work.

17:44.280 --> 17:48.280
Hernán, I'll pay you for these three "mutes", two meats, and a chicken.

17:48.280 --> 17:50.280
I'll pay in a moment, I'll pay in a moment.

17:51.400 --> 17:54.400
Father, but this is missing in the plate

18:11.400 --> 18:16.400
Zuli, Zuli, do me a favor, tell the firefighters to come to the stand to pick up their lunch.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.400
Yes, but now, now.

18:21.400 --> 18:25.400
Well, we continue to offer the chicken raffle, one ticket for three thousand, two for five thousand.

18:47.400 --> 18:54.400
So, this is from the empanadas funds.

19:06.400 --> 19:15.400
One hundred, one hundred fifty, four hundred fifty.

19:16.400 --> 19:20.400
You guys enjoy your eggs, right?

19:46.400 --> 19:50.400
