00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Well, the one who does good things, they don't suffer, they don't get lost, because the Bible itself says it,

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
they don't have sufferings, but if they do things wrong, then they do get lost.

00:18.000 --> 00:25.000
Yes, one day a priest asked us a lot of questions, and everyone fell silent,

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
and I said to him, well, that's why I believe that the one who dies, dies,

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
and the one who lives, if they want to live, is the one who pays attention, to see what will happen.

00:40.000 --> 00:50.000
Yes, there is another life, the other life, but that's for all the good ones that God has, He keeps them hidden,

00:50.000 --> 00:58.000
yes, those who are already lost, they go by another path,

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
originally, the Bible mentions the paths, the narrow path and the wide path,

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
and which path should one take? The narrow one, the wide one goes and takes the wide path,

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
it goes to hell, and the narrow one leads to glory,

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
and many say, no, I'll take the wide path, someone who could convince me more,

01:21.000 --> 01:28.000
well, the wide path is a lie, that's for hell, the devil leads you there.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
What is love?

01:31.000 --> 01:38.000
Love is wanting your spouse, being voluntary with them, esteeming them and adoring them,

01:39.000 --> 01:47.000
I tell many people, I love and esteem my spouse and adore her until the day God keeps me alive,

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
and I have asked my God not to let me die from any severe illness,

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
that when He remembers me, I die and my children don't have to suffer,

02:01.000 --> 02:11.000
that my father made me suffer during his illness, I said no, may God remember and take me away quickly.
