00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Well, the one who does good things, that person doesn't suffer,
they don't get lost, because the Bible itself says so,

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
they don't have sufferings, but if someone 
does things wrong, then they do get lost.

00:18.000 --> 00:25.000
One day a priest asked us a question,
and everyone remained silent,

00:25.000 --> 00:33.000
and I told him: well, that's why I believe 
that when someone dies, they die,

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
and the one who stays alive, is the one 
who pays attention to what will happen.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Yes, there is another life, the afterlife,

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
but that's for all the good ones that God has, 
He has choosen them,

00:50.000 --> 00:58.000
yes, those who are already lost, they go through another path,

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
that's why the Bible says there are two paths, 
the narrow path and the wide path,

01:03.000 --> 01:11.000
and which path should you take: the narrow one,
if you take the wide one, you're heading to hell,

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
and the narrow one leads to glory,

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
and many say:  "no, I'll take the wide path, it's easier",

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
it's a lie... I'm heading to hell,

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
the devil takes you there.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
- What is love?

01:32.000 --> 01:39.000
Love is wanting your wife, being kind to her,
treating her with respect and worshiping her,

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
I tell many people, I love her and cherish her

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
and I worship her until the day God keeps me alive,

01:48.000 --> 01:56.000
and I have asked my God not to 
let me die from some terrible illness,

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
that when He remembers me, when I die, 
my children don't have to suffer,

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
“Oh! my father made me suffer when he was ill”,

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
I said: no! may God remember me and take me away quickly.
