00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
My name is Soledad, but everyone calls me Sol.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.760
I consider myself a very hardworking woman, who has struggled since I was little.

00:32.760 --> 00:34.760
All my life has been about farming, it has been tobacco.

00:36.760 --> 00:43.760
It's like in that field I have always been working, working, and working.

01:20.760 --> 01:22.760
Well, the first thing you do is to fix the land

01:24.760 --> 01:30.760
It is dug into furrows and then the seedlings are brought.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.760
When it's small, it is watered almost every day.

01:40.760 --> 01:47.760
And after around 45 days, the first leaves that we call "bajera" are removed.

01:56.760 --> 02:07.760
In the past, men and women used to work the same way we do now, but the one who had the money, the one who decided what to do, was the man.

02:13.760 --> 02:19.760
Now it's very different, one also has their own harvest independent of what they work on.

02:29.760 --> 02:37.760
Hello? Hello Eduardo, how are you?... Eduardo I have a little tobacco for this week... for three and a half?  

02:38.760 --> 02:45.760
Eduardo is very cheap, you have to raise it a little... if you want, you can come and take a look.

02:577.000 --> 03:15.000
I am worried Pablo about that little spot that is coming out of the leaves is getting damaged. It is time to see what poison we can throw or what we can do so that it does not continue to come out more because otherwise it is not coming out of good quality and they will not pay a good price.


03:31.860 --> 03:36.860
At home, when I was single, I was the one my sisters always told...

03:36.860 --> 03:41.460
You go, you're the tough one, go and ask Dad for permission to go out.

03:44.060 --> 03:46.860
Until the moment I had a partner.

03:47.860 --> 03:52.460
When I moved in with the father of my children, because I live with my boyfriend now,

03:52.460 --> 03:57.060
I had that mentality or how we were raised that

03:57.060 --> 04:00.660
you had to endure infidelity, drunkenness.

04:01.660 --> 04:03.860
There were times when he didn't even come home.

04:04.260 --> 04:10.660
Until a point that the relationship couldn't go on and he left.

04:12.460 --> 04:17.660
I used to go to bed and watch the kids there and said, my god, to move forward with both of them.

04:18.660 --> 04:24.260
To move forward and work, come home and stay up all night, and wake up like that.


05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Did you ever go to school or not?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
No, I didn't.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000

Even before, they didn't let us study.


05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
No, because my mom doesn't know anything.
05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
And my mom did go to school, she finished high school in Curití, but after she got married, that was it...

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
That was the end of her education.

05:33.000 --> 05:49.000
She didn’t go on because my dad kind of didn’t agree that she studied and she missed that opportunity. And my mom is very smart! He taught us and the kids and the grandchildren too.


05:51.000 --> 05:56.460
Well, Leti knows very well the whole story of what I went through with the father of my children.


06:04.460 --> 06:12.460
He didn't agree with me joining the council because he knew that once I was on the council,

06:12.460 --> 06:18.460
I would have the power to be more independent,

06:18.460 --> 06:23.460
and I wouldn't depend on him financially anymore.

06:23.460 --> 06:25.460
Weren’t you afraid of this change, Nettie?

06:25.460 --> 06:28.460
Well, yes, and it was hard.

06:28.460 --> 06:30.460
Food, everything.

06:30.460 --> 06:34.460
And well, at first, I didn't think I was capable.

06:34.460 --> 06:41.460
And that's when I also set my mind to it, to have my own house.

06:41.460 --> 06:44.460
Alright, Lettie. Let's go inside.


06:51.460 --> 06:59.460
Sometimes I think, I don't know what happened to me or why I reached the point where we did whatever he said.

06:59.460 --> 07:02.460
At that time, I was very submissive,

07:02.460 --> 07:09.460
but when the relationship ended, I returned to being the girl I was before.

07:15.460 --> 07:21.460
Little by little, the wound healed until the day came when I didn't care anymore.

07:21.460 --> 07:26.460
Thank God it was something I was able to overcome.

07:29.460 --> 07:32.460
My love, women should be respected first.

07:32.460 --> 07:36.460
Women are not objects to have in the house

07:36.460 --> 07:39.460
to wash for me, to iron for me, and to cook for me.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.460
So let me know if you are going to play.

07:45.460 --> 07:47.460
Goodbye.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.460
Goodbye, Soledad.

07:59.460 --> 08:05.460
For me, home is where there is companionship, where love is.

08:05.460 --> 08:09.460
It's like the reason to get up in the morning.

08:09.460 --> 08:13.460
Despite all the difficulties, life is very beautiful,

08:13.460 --> 08:16.460
but there are still many challenges.

08:16.460 --> 08:23.460
Sometimes you feel sick or say, no, I can't take it anymore, I'm tired.

08:44.280 --> 08:46.280
Son, hello, son.

08:47.280 --> 08:51.280
Son, Let's go, get up. You got to go to study, get up quick!


08:58.280 --> 09:04.280
As parents, we want to give the best to our children, so they don't lack anything.


09:05.280 --> 09:11.280
Also, having my own house is one of my dreams.

09:12.280 --> 09:16.280
When I say: Alright, my house is just as I dreamed it, I finished it.

09:17.280 --> 09:22.280
That motivates me to work, to work and have my own things.


09:45.280 --> 09:46.280
Hello, doctor, good morning.

09.47.280 --> 09:57.280
Doctor, the thing is, here at the Morros school, well, I know that
It's the responsibility of the planning engineer, but I don't have his number either.


09:57.280 --> 10:03.280
Um, they're asking for the collaboration of some parents to do a work shift.

10:03.280 --> 10:04.280
of work.

10:07.280 --> 10:08.280
I love politics.

10:08.280 --> 10:14.280
And yes, even before becoming a councilwoman, I had already been nominated as a councilwoman.

10:14.280 --> 10:19.280
“Soledad is running because Soledad talks a lot with people, Soledad collaborates.”

10:19.280 --> 10:25.280
And when I ran for the council, well, thank God I was able to win, and now I'm on the council.

10:32.280 --> 10:35.280
What are the possibilities of being able to bring water from the river?

10:35.280 --> 10:37.280
The river is not far away.

10:37.280 --> 10:42.280
They could propose a project to extract water from the river and bring it to the streets

10:42.280 --> 10:44.280
so that they can work.

10:44.280 --> 10:47.280
That is a long-term project.

10:47.280 --> 10:52.280
Still, we cannot say that we will have it next year because that would be lying to them.

10:53.280 --> 10:56.280
The problem is also that not everyone agrees on that.

10:53.280 --> 10:56.280
There are some requests that cannot be fulfilled, like through the air.

10:59.280 --> 11:03.280
Permission from the landowner  must be requested for the location of the tanks.

11:04.280 --> 11:05.280
I promise you that when I become mayor…

11:06.280 --> 11:07.280
No, no. Don´t come here to make promises

11:07.280 --> 11:13.280
When I have your vote, when I become mayor, I will offer them the Minister of Water.

11:15.280 --> 11:16.280
At least the minister  of the water tank.

11:30.280 --> 11:33.280
I don't know why Jordán was so forgotten.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.280
They say it was previous administrations.

11:38.280 --> 11:42.280
No, no, Jordán doesn't progress because a father cursed it.

11:44.280 --> 11:49.280
Even the father doesn't like it when they say that Jordán was cursed.






11:50.280 --> 11:52.000
He says:  “no, Jordán is not cursed”.

11:52.280 --> 11:54.280
what Jordán lacks is determination to overcome it.


12:00.280 --> 12:08.280
Yes, engineer, we just wanted to check the status of the work. We are in the excavation process, removing everything.

12:08.280 --> 12:12.280
They are also removing what's inside the school.

12:12.280 --> 12:13.280
Yes.

12:18.280 --> 12:22.280
I am the only woman, and I think I'm the one who speaks the most in the council.

12:28.280 --> 12:33.280
Regarding the water issue, my opinion is that there should be more investment in that.

12:33.280 --> 12:39.280
Well, we know that we depend on tobacco, that the community in general works with tobacco.

12:39.280 --> 12:44.280
So it's very important that this project can be carried out

12:44.280 --> 12:50.280
and provide support to the people so they can move forward.



12:50.280 --> 12:56.280
So it's something great and really necessary here in Jordán.


12:58.280 --> 13:02.280
I would like to have more power to be able to make decisions,


13:02.280 --> 13:04.280
to be able to do something for the town.

13:09.280 --> 13:10.280
Thank you.

13:33.280 --> 13:37.280
We thank the municipal administration, each of the offices,


13:37.280 --> 13:40.280
each of its employees who have been providing their services with the organization in a very special way.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.280
Let's go!


14:43.280 --> 14:48.000
I distinguished Juan Pablo since I was a little girl, we even went to school together

14:49.280 --> 14:52.280
The relationship became official when I ran for council.

14:54.280 --> 14:58.280
We will even celebrate three years together with him, three years of being together.

14:59.280 --> 15:04.280
My relationship with Pablo has been very beautiful.

15:08.280 --> 15:12.280
Pablo and I are together, but for me, I am a single mother


15:13.000 --> 15:14.280
because I am the one who is supporting my children.

15:15.280 --> 15:20.000
For example, the house was my responsibility, and if I lay a brick,

15:20.280 --> 15:22.280
I will do it with my own work.




15:26.280 --> 15:27.280
Hello! Hello Eduardo! How are you?

15:28.280 --> 15:31.280
Eduardo, we are sorting out some tobacco for you.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.280
Okay, great!

15:32.280 --> 15:35.280
In the evening, I'll tell Pablo to go and get them.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.280
Alright, Eduardo!

15:38.280 --> 15:39.280
Okay, thank you.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.280
Do you see how it blows smoke?

15:50.280 --> 15:51.280
Look!

15:51.280 --> 15:52.280
From all sides.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.280
That's what the customer is interested in

15:56.280 --> 15:57.280
It burns right

15:57.280 --> 15:59.280
Yes, the part over here is white.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.280
It starts to white. That’s what he looks, that’s it


16:01.280 --> 16:02.280
Alright, let's negotiate now.

16:02.280 --> 16:03.280
Let's negotiate.

16:03.280 --> 16:05.280
How much for that little layer?

16:07.280 --> 16:09.280
How much are you asking?

16:09.280 --> 16:10.280
What?

16:10.280 --> 16:11.280
What? $500 something?

16:11.280 --> 16:13.280
They are at four pesos each.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.280
Oh my goodness!

16:14.280 --> 16:16.280
No, like for four twenty

16:16.280 --> 16:21.280
To make it quick, pay me four sixty and it's done.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.280
With forty?

16:24.280 --> 16:26.280
Alright, I'll give it to you for fifty and...

16:27.280 --> 16:28.280
Okay.


16:37.280 --> 16:46.280
My dream house has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and the front part

16:46.280 --> 16:49.280
should be all paved with a beautiful garden.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.280
I love it, I love the garden.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.280
And there should be a gate at the entrance.

16:54.280 --> 17:02.280
A gate where, well, I don't know, maybe I'll put Villasol or Fincasol.

17:04.280 --> 17:09.280
My name is Soledad, but everyone calls me Sol, so that would be my dream house.
