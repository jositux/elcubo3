00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
My name is Soledad, but everyone calls me Soledad.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
I consider myself a very hardworking woman.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
She's been carrying me since I was a child.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
She's still a grown-up, she's been tobacco.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
She's always been working and working for me.

00:56.000 --> 01:05.000
Miss Soledad lives with me, she served as the gardener

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
employment

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
for two months

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
I am Grisab suit

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Well the first thing you do is fix the soil.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
It splashes over the surface.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
And it's already brought to a boil.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
When it's small, it boils almost every day.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
And over there, about 45 days,

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
the first leaves are removed from the pot.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
In the olden days,

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
men and women used to work as we do now.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
But the one who had the money, the one who said he was going to be the man.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Now it's very different.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
You also have your independent harvest depending on what they are working on.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Let's introduce you to the man with the baby,

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Carre Bro legs,

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
and the baby who has a left.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
We look at how the baby will be paths and steps.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
The other day.

02:48.000 --> 03:18.000

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
I hope to see you in the next video, thanks for watching and I hope to see you in the next video, thanks for watching

03:48.000 --> 03:52.640
When I went with my father and my children, because he didn't want me to live with him now,

03:52.640 --> 03:59.440
I had that mentality, or how they had created us, that you had to hold on to infidelities,

03:59.440 --> 04:04.160
drunkards, there were times when the house was no longer there.

04:04.160 --> 04:11.120
So there was a term that the relationship no longer happened, and he left.

04:12.080 --> 04:17.120
I thought I was going to live with the children there, my God, to go forward with them,

04:17.120 --> 04:24.240
the two of them, to move forward and work, to get to the house and get old and get up and so on.

04:41.120 --> 05:11.120
I thought I was going to live with the children, to get to the house, to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get to the house and to get

05:11.120 --> 05:41.120
to the house and to get to the house and go to the house and to the house

05:41.120 --> 05:50.120
Yes, and my mom is very smart. She taught us, and the Chinese there are also the grandchildren.

05:51.120 --> 06:00.120
Well, let's see the story of what I saw with the father of my children. That change was for good.

06:00.120 --> 06:06.120
Did you see him very well? Yes, completely. He was there, I remember.

06:07.120 --> 06:11.120
I gave him the advice because he knew that he was already in the advice.

06:12.120 --> 06:18.120
The good thing was that he was going to have the power to be more independent.

06:19.120 --> 06:23.120
The other thing was that economically he was no longer going to depend on him.

06:23.120 --> 06:26.120
This did not give him the power to change, did it?

06:27.120 --> 06:35.120
Well, yes. At first I thought he was not going to have the power.

06:36.120 --> 06:41.120
And then I realized how in that, in having my own house.

06:42.120 --> 06:44.120
Ready for you. Let's go inside.

06:44.120 --> 06:58.120
I sometimes think, I don't know what happened to me, or why I got to that point where he did what he said.

06:59.120 --> 07:09.120
At that time I was very submissive, but when the relationship ended, I was like, I was going to be the girl who was ...

07:15.120 --> 07:21.120
Little by little the area was healing so that the day came that it already gave me the same ...

07:22.120 --> 07:25.120
Thank God, it was something that could overcome it.

07:29.120 --> 07:31.120
My love, women, first they respect each other.

07:32.120 --> 07:38.120
Women are not an object that I have women in the house so that they wash me, so that they plant me, so that they cook for me.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.120
So you have decided to play.

07:59.120 --> 08:05.120
For me, the place where there is company, where there is love,

08:05.120 --> 08:09.120
is like the reason for not getting up.

08:10.120 --> 08:16.120
Even though sometimes there are so many things, because life is very beautiful, but there are many difficulties.

08:17.120 --> 08:23.120
Sometimes you feel sick, or you say, there is no more, I'm tired.
