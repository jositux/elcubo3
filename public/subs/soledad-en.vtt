00:00.000 --> 00:20.760
My name is Soledad, but everyone calls me Sol.

00:20.760 --> 00:28.760
I consider myself a very hardworking woman, who has struggled since I was little.

00:32.760 --> 00:34.760
All my life has been about farming, it has been tobacco.

00:36.760 --> 00:43.760
It's like in that field I have always been working, working, and working.

01:20.760 --> 01:22.760
What does it mean to fix the land?

01:24.760 --> 01:30.760
It is dug into furrows and then the seedlings are brought.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.760
When it's small, it is fixed almost every day.

01:40.760 --> 01:47.760
And around 45 days, the first leaves that we call "bajera" are removed.

01:50.760 --> 02:07.760
In the past, men and women used to work the same way we do now, but the one who had the money, the one who decided what to do, was the man.

02:13.760 --> 02:19.760
Now it's very different, one also has their own harvest independent of what they work on.

02:20.760 --> 02:24.760
And around 45 days, the first leaves that we call "bajera" are removed.

03:31.860 --> 03:36.860
At home, when I was single, I was the one my sisters always told...

03:36.860 --> 03:41.460
You go, you're the tough one, go and ask Dad for permission to go out.

03:44.060 --> 03:46.860
Until the moment I had a partner.

03:47.860 --> 03:52.460
When I moved in with the father of my children, because I live with my boyfriend now,

03:52.460 --> 03:57.060
I had that mentality or how we were raised that

03:52.460 --> 03:57.060
I had that mentality or how we were raised that

03:57.060 --> 04:00.660
you had to endure infidelity, drunkenness.

04:01.660 --> 04:03.860
There were times when he didn't even come home.

04:04.260 --> 04:10.660
Until a point came where the relationship couldn't go on and he left.

04:12.460 --> 04:17.660
He accused me, lived with the kids there, my god, to move forward with both of them.

04:18.660 --> 04:24.260
To push forward and work, come home and stay up all night, and wake up like that.

05:03.860 --> 05:05.660
Did you ever go to school or not?

05:05.660 --> 05:08.660
No, I didn't. I had to see my daughter there and when...

05:08.660 --> 05:12.460
Earlier, when they sent us to study or not, they didn't let us study.

05:12.460 --> 05:13.660
Nothing, because my mom doesn't know anything.

05:13.660 --> 05:19.860
And my mom did go to school, she finished high school in Curití, but after she got married, that was it...

05:19.860 --> 05:20.660
And she left?

05:20.660 --> 05:22.460
That was the end of her education.

05:22.460 --> 05:28.660
They kept going with dad's favorite, with my mom, with my mom, with my mom, with my mom, with my mom, with my mom.

05:29.060 --> 05:35.460
Well, in fact, you know the whole story of what I went through with the father of my children.

05:36.460 --> 05:41.460
That case, well, it had just happened to you, and before that, there was something that happened every day.

05:41.460 --> 05:42.460
You were expecting.

05:42.460 --> 05:45.460
Lo que eso lo hizo fue conendo e ir admitting eso.

05:49.460 --> 05:58.460
Well, Nettie knows very well the whole story of what I went through with the father of my children.

05:58.460 --> 06:00.460
That change was for the better.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.460
Did she see it a lot then?

06:02.460 --> 06:04.460
Yes, completely.

06:04.460 --> 06:12.460
He didn't agree with me joining the council because he knew that once I was on the council,

06:12.460 --> 06:18.460
I would have the power to be more independent,

06:18.460 --> 06:23.460
and I wouldn't depend on him financially anymore.

06:23.460 --> 06:25.460
Wasn't he afraid of this change, Nettie?

06:25.460 --> 06:28.460
Well, yes, and it was difficult.

06:28.460 --> 06:30.460
Food, everything.

06:30.460 --> 06:34.460
And well, at first, I didn't think I was capable.

06:35.460 --> 06:41.460
And that's when I also set my mind to it, to have my own house.

06:41.460 --> 06:44.460
Alright, Nettie. Let's go inside.

06:51.460 --> 06:59.460
Sometimes I think, I don't know what happened to me or why I reached the point where I did whatever he said.

06:59.460 --> 07:02.460
At that time, I was very submissive,

07:02.460 --> 07:09.460
but when the relationship ended, I returned to being the girl I was before.

07:15.460 --> 07:21.460
Little by little, the wound healed until the day came when I didn't care anymore.

07:21.460 --> 07:26.460
Thank God it was something I was able to overcome.

07:29.460 --> 07:32.460
My love, women should be respected first.

07:32.460 --> 07:36.460
Women are not objects to have the woman in the house

07:36.460 --> 07:39.460
to wash for me, to iron for me, and to cook for me.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.460
So let them know, they are going to play.

07:45.460 --> 07:47.460
Goodbye.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.460
Goodbye, solitude.

07:59.460 --> 08:05.460
For me, home is where there is companionship, where love is.

08:05.460 --> 08:09.460
It's like the reason to get up in the morning.

08:09.460 --> 08:13.460
Despite all the difficulties, life is very beautiful,

08:13.460 --> 08:16.460
but there are still many challenges.

08:16.460 --> 08:23.460
Sometimes you feel sick or say, no, I can't take it anymore, I'm tired.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.280
Son, hello, son.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.280
Let's go, get up.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.280
I want to study.

08:45.280 --> 08:46.280
Okay.

08:46.280 --> 08:47.280
Let's go.

08:54.280 --> 09:00.280
As parents, we want to give the best to our children, so they don't lack anything.

09:00.280 --> 09:05.280
Also, having my own house is one of my dreams.

09:05.280 --> 09:10.280
Alright, my house is just as I dreamed it, I finished it.

09:10.280 --> 09:15.280
That motivates me to work, to work and have my own things.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.280
Hello, doctor, good morning.

09:36.280 --> 09:52.280
Doctor, the thing is, here at the Morros school, well, I know that
it's the responsibility of the planning engineer, but I don't have his number either.

09:52.280 --> 09:57.280
This, they're asking me for the collaboration of some parents to do a work shift.

09:57.280 --> 10:03.280
Um, they're asking for the collaboration of some parents to do a work shift.

10:03.280 --> 10:04.280
of work.

10:07.280 --> 10:08.280
I love politics.

10:08.280 --> 10:14.280
And yes, even before becoming a councilwoman, I had already been nominated as a councilwoman.

10:14.280 --> 10:19.280
Soledad is running because Soledad talks a lot with people, Soledad collaborates.

10:19.280 --> 10:25.280
And when I ran for the council, well, thank God I was able to win, and now I'm on the council.

10:25.280 --> 10:35.280
What are the possibilities of being able to bring water from the river?

10:35.280 --> 10:37.280
The river is not far away.

10:37.280 --> 10:42.280
They could propose a project to extract water from the river and bring it to the streets

10:42.280 --> 10:44.280
so that they can work.

10:44.280 --> 10:47.280
That is a long-term project.

10:47.280 --> 10:52.280
Still, we cannot say that we will have it next year because that would be lying to them.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.280
The problem is also that not everyone agrees on that.

10:53.280 --> 10:56.280
There are some requests that cannot be fulfilled, like through the air.

10:56.280 --> 10:59.280
Permission must be requested for the location of the tanks, from the landowner.

10:59.280 --> 11:03.280
I promise you that when I become mayor...

11:05.280 --> 11:07.280
Because people will eat it.

11:07.280 --> 11:13.280
When I have your vote, when I become mayor, I will offer them the Minister of Water.

11:13.280 --> 11:15.280
That's how it is already in tanks.

11:23.280 --> 11:28.280
I don't know why Jordán was so forgotten.

11:28.280 --> 11:32.280
They say it was previous administrations.

11:32.280 --> 11:37.280
No, no, Jordán doesn't progress because a father cursed it.

11:37.280 --> 11:43.280
Even the father doesn't like it when they say that Jordán was cursed.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.280
They say, no, Jordán is not cursed.

11:45.280 --> 11:49.280
Jordán is lacking someone who is cursed.

11:49.280 --> 11:54.280
Jordán is not cursed, what Jordán lacks is determination to overcome it.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.280
We are in the excavation shift, yes.

12:06.280 --> 12:08.280
They are removing everything.

12:08.280 --> 12:12.280
They are also removing what's inside the school.

12:12.280 --> 12:13.280
Yes.

12:18.280 --> 12:22.280
I am the only woman, and I think I'm the one who speaks the most in the council.

12:28.280 --> 12:33.280
Regarding the water issue, my opinion is that there should be more investment in that.

12:33.280 --> 12:39.280
Well, we know that we depend on tobacco, that the community in general works with tobacco.

12:39.280 --> 12:44.280
So it's very important that this project can be carried out

12:44.280 --> 12:50.280
and provide support to the people so they can move forward.

12:50.280 --> 12:56.280
So it's something great and really necessary here in Jordán.

12:58.280 --> 13:02.280
I would like to have more power to be able to make decisions,

13:02.280 --> 13:04.280
to be able to do something for the town.

13:09.280 --> 13:10.280
Thank you.

13:33.280 --> 13:37.280
We appreciate the municipal administration, each of the offices,

13:37.280 --> 13:40.280
each of its employees who have been providing their services with the organization in a very special way.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.280
Let's go!

14:37.280 --> 14:42.280
Juan Pablo has been saying it since we were kids, we were even together.

14:43.280 --> 14:47.280
The relationship became official when I ran for council.

14:48.280 --> 14:53.280
We will even celebrate three years together with him, three years of being together.

14:54.280 --> 14:58.280
But my relationship with Pablo has been very beautiful.

14:58.280 --> 15:02.280
Pablo and I are together, but for me, I am a single mother

15:02.280 --> 15:05.280
because I am the one who is supporting my children.

15:06.280 --> 15:10.280
For example, the house was my responsibility, and if I lay a brick,

15:10.280 --> 15:12.280
I will do it with my own work.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.280
Hello! Hello Eduardo!

15:17.280 --> 15:18.280
How are you?

15:18.280 --> 15:19.280
How are you?

15:19.280 --> 15:20.280
How are you?

15:20.280 --> 15:21.280
How are you?

15:21.280 --> 15:22.280
How are you?

15:22.280 --> 

15:23.280
How are you?

15:23.280 --> 15:24.280
How are you?

15:25.280 --> 15:26.280
Hello!

15:26.280 --> 15:27.280
Hello Eduardo!

15:28.280 --> 15:31.280
Eduardo, we are sorting out some tobacco for you.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.280
Okay, great!

15:32.280 --> 15:35.280
In the evening, I'll tell Pablo to come and get them.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.280
Alright, Eduardo!

15:38.280 --> 15:39.280
Okay, thank you.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.280
Do you see how I'm blowing smoke?

15:50.280 --> 15:51.280
Look!

15:51.280 --> 15:52.280
From all sides.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.280
That's what you're interested in, the hotel.

15:56.280 --> 15:57.280
And there are good brands.

15:57.280 --> 15:59.280
Yes, the part over here is white.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.280
I have whitened it, see what it looks like now.

16:01.280 --> 16:02.280
Alright, let's negotiate now.

16:02.280 --> 16:03.280
Let's negotiate.

16:03.280 --> 16:05.280
How much are you paying for that batch?

16:07.280 --> 16:09.280
How much are you asking for?

16:09.280 --> 16:10.280
What?

16:10.280 --> 16:11.280
For 500, right?

16:11.280 --> 16:13.280
They are already at four pesos each.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.280
Oh my goodness!

16:14.280 --> 16:16.280
Not for four twenty, not paying?

16:16.280 --> 16:21.280
To make it quick, pay me four sixty and it's done.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.280
With forty?

16:24.280 --> 16:26.280
Alright, I'll give it to you for fifty and...

16:27.280 --> 16:28.280
Okay.

16:37.280 --> 16:46.280
My dream house has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and the front part

16:46.280 --> 16:49.280
should be all paved with a beautiful garden.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.280
I love it, I love the garden.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.280
And there should be a gate at the entrance.

16:54.280 --> 17:02.280
A gate where, well, I don't know, maybe I'll put Villasol or Fincasol.

17:04.280 --> 17:09.280
My name is Soledad, but everyone calls me Sol, so that would be my dream house.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.280
Soledad.
