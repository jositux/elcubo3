00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
My name is Soledad, but everyone calls me Sol.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.00
I consider myself a very hardworking woman, 

00:26.000 --> 00:29.00
who has struggled since I was little.

00:32.760 --> 00:36.760
All my life has been about farming, it has been tobacco.

00:36.760 --> 00:39.000
It's like in that field I have always 

00:39.000  --> 00:43.000
been working, working, and working.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.760
Well, the first thing you do is to fix the land

01:24.760 --> 01:30.760
It is dug into furrows and then the seedlings are brought.

01:31.760 --> 01:34.760
When it's small, it is watered almost every day.

01:40.760 --> 01:44.760
And after around 45 days, 

01:44.760 --> 01:48.760
the first leaves that we call "bajera" are removed.

01:56.760 --> 02:02.760
In the past, men and women used to work the same way we do now, 

02:03.000 --> 02:08.760
but the one who had the money, the one who decided what to do, was the man.

02:13.760 --> 02:19.760
Now it's very different, one also has their own 
harvest independent of what they work on.

02:29.760 --> 02:32.760
Hello? Hello Eduardo, how are you?... 

02:32.760 --> 02:36.760
Eduardo I have a little tobacco for this week... 

02:36.760 --> 02:41.760
for three and a half?  
No, Eduardo is very cheap, you have to raise it a little 

02:41.760 --> 02:45.760
...if you want, you can come and take a look.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
I am worried Pablo about that little 
spot that is coming out of the leaves 

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
is getting damaged. It is time to see what poison we can throw 

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
or what we can do so that it does not continue to come out more 

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
because otherwise it is not coming out of good 
quality and they will not pay a good price.

03:31.860 --> 03:34.860
At home, when I was single, 

03:34.860 --> 03:38.860
I was the one my sisters always told...
You go, you're the tough one,

03:38.860 --> 03:42.460
go and ask Dad for permission to go out.

03:44.060 --> 03:46.860
Until the moment I had a partner.

03:47.860 --> 03:52.460
When I moved in with the father of my children, 
because I live with my boyfriend now,

03:52.460 --> 03:57.060
I had that mentality or how we were raised that

03:57.060 --> 04:00.660
you had to endure infidelity, drunkenness.

04:01.660 --> 04:03.860
There were times when he didn't even come home.

04:04.260 --> 04:10.660
Until a point that the relationship couldn't go on and he left.

04:12.460 --> 04:17.660
I used to go to bed and watch the kids there and said, 
my god, to move forward with both of them.

04:18.660 --> 04:24.260
To move forward and work, come home and stay up all night, and wake up like that.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Did you ever go to school or not?

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
No, I didn't.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Even before, they didn't let us study.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
No, because my mom doesn't know anything.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
And my mom did go to school, she finished high school 
in Curití, but after she got married, that was it...

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
That was the end of her education.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
She didn’t go on because my dad kind of didn’t agree 

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
that she studied and she missed that opportunity. 

05:41.000 --> 05:49.000
And my mom is very smart! He taught us 
and the kids and the grandchildren too.


05:51.000 --> 05:57.460
Well, Leti knows very well the whole story of what I went through with the father of my children.


06:04.460 --> 06:12.460
He didn't agree with me joining the council because he knew that once I was on the council,

06:12.460 --> 06:18.460
I would have the power to be more independent,

06:18.460 --> 06:23.460
and I wouldn't depend on him financially anymore.

06:23.460 --> 06:25.460
Weren’t you afraid of this change, Nettie?

06:25.460 --> 06:28.460
Well, yes, and it was hard.

06:28.460 --> 06:30.460
Food, everything.

06:30.460 --> 06:35.460
And well, at first, I didn't think I was capable.

06:35.460 --> 06:41.460
And that's when I also set my mind to it, to have my own house.

06:41.460 --> 06:45.460
Alright, Lettie. Let's go inside.

06:51.460 --> 06:54.460
Sometimes I think, I don't know what happened to me 

06:54.460 --> 06:59.460
or why I reached the point where we did whatever he said.

06:59.460 --> 07:02.460
At that time, I was very submissive,

07:02.460 --> 07:10.460
but when the relationship ended, I returned to being the girl I was before.

07:15.460 --> 07:21.460
Little by little, the wound healed until the day came when I didn't care anymore.

07:21.460 --> 07:26.460
Thank God it was something I was able to overcome.

07:29.460 --> 07:32.460
My love, women should be respected first.

07:32.460 --> 07:36.460
Women are not objects to have in the house

07:36.460 --> 07:39.460
to wash for me, to iron for me, and to cook for me.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.460
So let me know if you are going to play.

07:45.460 --> 07:47.460
Goodbye.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.460
Goodbye, Soledad.

07:59.460 --> 08:05.460
For me, home is where there is companionship, where love is.

08:05.460 --> 08:09.460
It's like the reason to get up in the morning.

08:09.460 --> 08:13.460
Despite all the difficulties, life is very beautiful,

08:13.460 --> 08:16.460
but there are still many challenges.

08:16.460 --> 08:23.460
Sometimes you feel sick or say, no, I can't take it anymore, I'm tired.

08:44.280 --> 08:46.280
Son, hello, son.

08:47.280 --> 08:52.280
Son, Let's go, get up. You got to go to study, get up quick!


08:58.280 --> 09:04.280
As parents, we want to give the best to our children, so they don't lack anything.


09:05.280 --> 09:11.280
Also, having my own house is one of my dreams.

09:12.280 --> 09:16.280
When I say: Alright, my house is just as I dreamed it, I finished it.

09:17.280 --> 09:22.280
That motivates me to work, to work and have my own things.


09:44.280 --> 09:47.280
Hello, doctor, good morning.

09.47.280 --> 09:52.280
Doctor, the thing is, here at the Morros school, well, I know that

09:52.280 --> 09:57.280
It's the responsibility of the planning engineer, but I don't have his number either.

09:57.280 --> 10:04.280
Um, they're asking for the collaboration 
of some parents to do a work, shift of work.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.280
I love politics.

10:09.280 --> 10:14.280
And yes, even before becoming a councilwoman, I had already been nominated as a councilwoman.

10:14.280 --> 10:19.280
“Soledad is running because Soledad talks a lot with people, Soledad collaborates.”

10:19.280 --> 10:26.280
And when I ran for the council, well, thank God I was able to win, and now I'm on the council.

10:32.280 --> 10:35.280
What are the possibilities of being able to bring water from the river?

10:35.280 --> 10:37.280
The river is not far away.

10:37.280 --> 10:42.280
They could propose a project to extract water from the river and bring it to the streets

10:42.280 --> 10:44.280
so that they can work.

10:44.280 --> 10:47.280
That is a long-term project.

10:47.280 --> 10:53.280
Still, we cannot say that we will have it next year because that would be lying to them.

10:53.280 --> 10:57.280
The problem is also that not everyone agrees on that.

10:59.280 --> 11:03.280
Permission from the landowner must be requested for the location of the tanks.

11:04.280 --> 11:07.280
I promise you that when I become mayor…
No, no. Don´t come here to make promises

11:07.280 --> 11:13.280
When I have your vote, when I become mayor, I will offer them the Minister of Water.

11:15.280 --> 11:18.280
At least the minister  of the water tank.

11:30.280 --> 11:34.280
I don't know why Jordán was so forgotten.

11:35.280 --> 11:38.280
They say it was previous administrations.

11:38.280 --> 11:42.280
No, no, Jordán doesn't progress because a father cursed it.

11:44.280 --> 11:50.280
Even the father doesn't like it when they say that Jordán was cursed.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.000
He says:  “no, Jordán is not cursed”.

11:52.280 --> 11:55.280
what Jordán lacks is determination to overcome it.

12:00.280 --> 12:08.280
Yes, engineer, we just wanted to check the status of the work. We are in the excavation process, removing everything.

12:08.280 --> 12:12.280
They are also removing what's inside the school.

12:12.280 --> 12:13.280
Yes.

12:18.280 --> 12:22.280
I am the only woman, and I think I'm the one who speaks the most in the council.

12:28.280 --> 12:33.280
Regarding the water issue, my opinion is that there should be more investment in that.

12:33.280 --> 12:39.280
Well, we know that we depend on tobacco, that the community in general works with tobacco.

12:39.280 --> 12:44.280
So it's very important that this project can be carried out

12:44.280 --> 12:50.280
and provide support to the people so they can move forward.

12:50.280 --> 12:56.280
So it's something great and really necessary here in Jordán.

12:58.280 --> 13:02.280
I would like to have more power to be able to make decisions,

13:02.280 --> 13:04.280
to be able to do something for the town.

13:33.280 --> 13:37.280
We thank the municipal administration, each of the offices,

13:37.280 --> 13:40.280
each of its employees who have been providing their services with the organization in a very special way.

14:43.280 --> 14:49.000
I distinguished Juan Pablo since I was a little girl, we even went to school together

14:49.280 --> 14:53.280
The relationship became official when I ran for council.

14:54.280 --> 14:58.280
We will even celebrate three years together with him, three years of being together.

14:59.280 --> 15:05.280
My relationship with Pablo has been very beautiful.

15:08.280 --> 15:12.280
Pablo and I are together, but for me, I am a single mother

15:12.280 --> 15:15.280
because I am the one who is supporting my children.

15:15.280 --> 15:20.000
For example, the house was my responsibility, and if I lay a brick,

15:20.280 --> 15:23.280
I will do it with my own work.

15:26.280 --> 15:27.280
Hello! Hello Eduardo! How are you?

15:28.280 --> 15:31.280
Eduardo, we are sorting out some tobacco for you.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.280
Okay, great!

15:32.280 --> 15:35.280
In the evening, I'll tell Pablo to go and get them.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.280
Alright, Eduardo!

15:38.280 --> 15:39.280
Okay, thank you.

15:48.280 --> 15:51.280
Do you see how it blows smoke?
Look!

15:51.280 --> 15:53.280
From all sides.

15:53.280 --> 15:57.280
That's what the customer is interested in
It burns right

15:57.280 --> 16:00.280
Yes, the part over here is white.
It starts to white. That’s what he looks, that’s it

16:01.280 --> 16:03.280
Alright, let's negotiate now.

16:03.280 --> 16:06.280
Let's negotiate.
How much for that little layer?

16:07.280 --> 16:09.280
How much are you asking?

16:09.280 --> 16:12.280
What? What? $500 something?

16:12.280 --> 16:14.280
They are at four pesos each.

16:14.280 --> 16:16.280
Oh my goodness!

16:16.280 --> 16:18.280
No, like for four twenty

16:18.280 --> 16:22.280
To make it quick, pay me four sixty and it's done.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.280
With forty?

16:25.280 --> 16:27.280
Alright, I'll give it to you for fifty and...

16:27.280 --> 16:29.280
Okay.

16:37.280 --> 16:46.280
My dream house has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, 

16:46.280 --> 16:49.280
and the front part should be all paved with a beautiful garden.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.280
I love it, I love the garden.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.280
And there should be a gate at the entrance.

16:54.280 --> 17:03.280
A gate where, well, I don't know, maybe I'll put Villasol or Fincasol.

17:04.280 --> 17:10.280
My name is Soledad, but everyone calls me Sol, so that would be my dream house.
