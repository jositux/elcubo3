00:01.000 --> 00:06.000
It may seem a bit simple, but because 
of the Santanderean culture...

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
We have been told that men don't cry

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
But... I cried a lot, Ok?

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
Because... loneliness (tearful)

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
and the situations I faced were very strong.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
And nothing was built, at least administratively.

00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
First days my mom and brother accompanied me,

00:42.000 --> 00:49.000
They were days of cleaning, accommodating things,
The weather hit me hard...

00:49.000 --> 00:57.000
I came from a calm climate, where the temperature
maximum is about 30 degrees and that is considered heat.

00:57.000 --> 01:06.000
To suffer in January, February, when here 
temperatures sometimes reach 42 to 45 degrees.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Accustomed to seeing rain every day
and here the first days don't rain

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
Even that was hard for me, it was very hard

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Time ago accustomed to celebrate the Eucharist with a full temple

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
with great crowd participation, regardless of what it was
