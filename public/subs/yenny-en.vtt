00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
When I arrived at the sea, I felt a lot of excitement 
to see that immensity of water that went far and far, 
and I didn't know where it would end.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
Something amazing.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
And I will be in the sea there, getting wet, which I have never done, right?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Yenny.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Yenny.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Come.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
I'm coming!

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
I'm coming!

00:56.000 --> 01:10.000
Let's make an ajjiaco today, with yuca, potatoes, beans, celery, carrots, and meat.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Jenny.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Come, do me a little favor

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
Well, they call my aunts "señoritas" because they are single and didn't get married. They lived like that.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
They didn't go to live with anyone.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
Our Lord, their knees bend and they fall, but we stand firm and upright.

01:46.000 --> 01:53.000
Lord, give victory to the King. Answer us when we call you. Glory to the Father and to God the Holy Spirit.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Amen.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
Jesus, my Lord and Redeemer, I repent of all the sins I have committed until today,

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
What I like most in life is to travel

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
When you see places, locations, people.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
I don't feel like, free.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
I can't go anywhere, I can't, I have to watch the time, when I go, when I come back, hurry up.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
It's like a restriction that I have there.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Jenny.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Come.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Let's help the Priest, let's help with the animation of the mass, but let them pay us.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
That way, we have for the lunch.


03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
Thank God we have a mate that doesn’t drink or eat

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
No, but over there, in Jordan, that they let him go and say no, this, take it and give it to us.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
She became mute.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Imagine!

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
My mom, very simple, hardworking.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
She is like the owner of the house.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Jenny, let's go!

04:36.000 --> 04:44.000
Let's praise the Lord

04:44.000 --> 05:02.200
Well, to me it seems that being single is good because you have the freedom to go out somewhere

05:02.200 --> 05:12.400
enjoy life, not have like prisons, imposition from another person, a partner, be

05:12.400 --> 05:18.160
free and you can come home a little later as they say.

05:42.400 --> 06:11.600
My aunt María Antonia, very helpful, but sometimes she is a bit rebel,

06:11.600 --> 06:32.680
You have to know how to handle her. Memories, memories of my family when they were young, very beautiful,

06:32.680 --> 06:43.040
very lovely. They lived well before, enjoyed life, went to parties, went to other

06:43.040 --> 06:52.440
places to dance. The years are wearing them out now, just work, so youth is gone,

06:52.440 --> 07:14.520
leaving behind weariness. With age comes more illnesses. If one day I woke up

07:14.520 --> 07:20.400
and no one was there, I would feel really bad, very lonely, because I have no one to talk to,

07:20.400 --> 07:24.840
to hear their shouts, their scolding, or call me.

07:51.240 --> 07:56.760
Well, my aunt Paulina, who is the oldest, is very cheerful,

07:56.760 --> 08:01.000
very enthusiastic about everything, she loves music.

08:11.600 --> 08:19.280
My aunt Hermina is very quiet, she is very quiet, she hardly speaks, she doesn't like to talk.

09:04.540 --> 09:06.840
Well, and the relationship with my mom, I get along with her

09:10.140 --> 09:12.040
She takes care of me a lot

09:12.040 --> 09:14.040
as I was her only daughter.

09:42.040 --> 09:45.040
The blessing of God Almighty, Father,

09:45.040 --> 09:50.040
Son, and Holy Spirit, descend upon you and be with us always. Amen.

09:50.040 --> 09:53.040
For me, the importance thing in my life is

09:53.040 --> 09:57.040
to have Jesus in every moment.

10:03.040 --> 10:06.040
My aunt, María Antonia, instilled this in me.

10:12.040 --> 10:17.040
Well, what has activated me to do in life is

10:17.040 --> 10:22.040
the dream of going to Barranquilla is like studying.

10:28.040 --> 10:32.040
It's like where I live and I want to learn a little more

10:32.040 --> 10:35.040
to reinforce that knowledge in the field.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.040
What was this, or what?

10:37.040 --> 10:40.040
For the secret friend thing we already mentioned.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.040
And there we would share.

10:42.040 --> 10:45.040
Those of us who wanted, always with the detail.

10:45.040 --> 10:46.040
Yes.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.040
If we wanted a little bit less, that was also possible.

10:48.040 --> 10:51.040
And then we're going to have an afternoon there,

10:51.040 --> 10:53.040
an activity, more or less,


11:04.040 --> 11:06.040
We're talking about a sancocho,

11:06.040 --> 11:07.040
A “mute”.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.040
We're going to do something there to share.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.040
I mean, we'll leave from lunch.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.040
Of course, ma'am.

11:11.040 --> 11:15.040
And the other more important thing is the carranga live show!.

11:32.040 --> 11:35.040
Wow, this is amazing.


11:57.040 --> 12:00.040
For me, freedom is enjoying it.

12:00.040 --> 12:04.040
To live it every day.


12:08.040 --> 12:11.040
Without worries, without fears.

12:22.040 --> 12:25.040
Hello. Hello. Hello.

13:30.040 --> 13:34.040
Well, “Sweet” friend, for the first time I'm going to play

13:34.040 --> 13:36.040
a very simple friend.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.040
Her name is Leonela.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.040
Oh!


13:42.040 --> 13:44.040
Done with me or not yet?

13:44.040 --> 13:46.040
My friend is Jenny Delgado

13:46.040 --> 13:48.040
Oh!

13:48.040 --> 13:50.040
Oh!

13:50.040 --> 13:52.040
Oh!

13:52.040 --> 13:54.040
Oh!

13:54.040 --> 13:56.040
Now, yes!

13:56.040 --> 13:58.040
Now, yes!

13:58.040 --> 14:00.040
Let the party continue!

14:08.040 --> 14:11.040
What would happen if one day I decided to leave?

14:16.040 --> 14:20.040
They would die crying in anguish, because they wouldn’t see me no more.

14:22.040 --> 14:26.040
If I were to leave, it would be a little different, right?

14:26.040 --> 14:31.040
Another environment where I might meet someone else

14:31.040 --> 14:34.040
or things would change a lot, right?
