00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
When I arrived at the sea, I felt a lot of excitement 

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
to see that immensity of water that went far and far, and I didn't know where it would end.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Something amazing.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
And I will be in the sea there, getting wet, which I have never done, right?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Yenny.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Yenny.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Come.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
I'm coming!

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
I'm coming!

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Let's make an ajiaco today

00:57.000 --> 01:10.000
with yuca, potatoes, beans, celery, carrots, and meat.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
Yenny. Come, do me a little favor

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
Well, they call my aunts "señoritas" because they are single and didn't get married. They lived like that.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
They didn't go to live with anyone.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
Our Lord, their knees bend and they fall, but we stand firm and upright.

01:46.000 --> 01:53.000
Lord, give victory to the King. Answer us when we call you. Glory to the Father and to God the Holy Spirit.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
Amen.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
Jesus, my Lord and Redeemer, I repent of all the sins I have committed until today,

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
(Praying)

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
What I like most in life is to travel

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
When you see places, locations, 

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
People.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
I don't feel like, free.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
I can't go anywhere, I can't, I have to watch the time,


03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
when I go, when I come back, hurry up.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
It's like a restriction that I have there.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
Yenny! Come.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
Let's help the Priest, let's help with the animation of the mass, but let them pay us.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
That way, we have for the lunch.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
Thank God we have a mate that doesn’t drink or eat

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
No, that they let him go and say no, this, take it and give it to us.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
She became mute.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Opine!

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
My mom, very simple, hardworking.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
She is like the owner of the house.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Yenny, let's go!

04:36.000 --> 04:44.000
Let's praise the Lord (religious song)

04:54.000 --> 04:57.200
Well, to me it seems that being single is good 

04:57.000 --> 05:01.200
because you have the freedom to go out somewhere

05:02.200 --> 05:07.400
enjoy life, not have like prisons, 

05:07.200 --> 05:12.400
imposition from another person, a partner,

05:12.400 --> 05:18.160
be free and you can come home a little later as they say.

06:02.400 --> 06:07.600
My aunt María Antonia, very helpful, 

06:07.600 --> 06:13.600
but sometimes she is a bit rebel, You have to know how to handle her

06:29.600 --> 06:34.680
Memories, memories of my family when they were young, very beautiful, very lovely. 

06:37.680 --> 06:42.040
They lived well before, enjoyed life, went to parties, 

06:42.040 --> 06:46.440
went to other places to dance. 

06:47.040 --> 06:50.440
The years are wearing them out now, just work, so youth is gone,

06:50.040 --> 06:55.440
leaving behind weariness. 

06:55.440 --> 07:06.520
With age comes more illnesses. 

07:12.520 --> 07:17.400
If one day I woke up and no one was there, I would feel really bad, very lonely, 

07:18.520 --> 07:25.400
because I have no one to talk to, to hear their shouts, their scolding, or call me.

07:52.240 --> 07:56.760
Well, my aunt Paulina, who is the oldest, is very cheerful,

07:56.760 --> 08:01.000
very enthusiastic about everything, she loves music.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Yenny! Come, help me?

08:14.600 --> 08:19.280
My aunt Hermina is very quiet, she is very quiet, she hardly speaks, she doesn't like to talk.

09:03.540 --> 09:07.840
Well, and the relationship with my mom, I get along with her

09:10.140 --> 09:12.040
She takes care of me a lot

09:12.040 --> 09:15.040
as I was her only daughter.

09:42.040 --> 09:45.040
The blessing of God Almighty, Father,

09:45.040 --> 09:50.040
Son, and Holy Spirit, descend upon you and be with us always. Amen.

09:50.040 --> 09:53.040
For me, the importance thing in my life is

09:53.040 --> 09:57.040
to have Jesus in every moment.

10:03.040 --> 10:07.040
My aunt, María Antonia, instilled this in me.

10:18.040 --> 10:23.040
Well, what has activated me to do in life is

10:23.040 --> 10:28.040
the dream of going to Barranquilla is like studying.

10:34.040 --> 10:37.040
It's like where I live and I want to learn a little more

10:37.040 --> 10:42.040
to reinforce that knowledge in the field.

10:46.040 --> 10:49.040
What was this, or what?

10:49.040 --> 10:53.040
For the secret friend thing we already mentioned. And there we would share.

10:53.040 --> 10:56.040
Those of us who wanted, always with the detail.


10:57.040 --> 11:04.040
If we wanted a little bit less, that was also possible. And then we're going to have an afternoon there, an activity, more or less,

11:04.040 --> 11:09.040
We're talking about a sancocho, A “mute”.
We're going to do something there to share.

11:09.040 --> 11:12.040
I mean, we'll leave from lunch?
Of course, ma'am.

11:12.040 --> 11:16.040
And the other more important thing is the carranga live show!.

11:32.040 --> 11:35.040
Wow, this is amazing.

11:57.040 --> 12:04.040
For me, freedom is enjoying it. To live it every day.

12:08.040 --> 12:11.040
Without worries, without fears.

12:22.040 --> 12:25.040
Hello. Hello. Hello.

13:30.040 --> 13:34.040
Well, “Sweet” friend, for the first time I'm going to play

13:34.040 --> 13:36.040
a very simple friend.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.040
Her name is Leonela.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.040
Oh!

13:42.040 --> 13:44.040
Done with me or not yet?

13:44.040 --> 13:46.040
My friend is Jenny Delgado

13:46.040 --> 13:49.040
Oh!

13:53.040 --> 13:56.040
Now, yes! Let the party continue!

14:08.040 --> 14:11.040
What would happen if one day I decided to leave?

14:16.040 --> 14:20.040
They would die crying in anguish, because they wouldn’t see me no more.

14:22.040 --> 14:26.040
If I were to leave, it would be a little different, right?

14:26.040 --> 14:31.040
Another environment where I might meet someone else

14:31.040 --> 14:35.040
or things would change a lot, right?
