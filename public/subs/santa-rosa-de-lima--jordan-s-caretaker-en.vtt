That has a story that has even caught my attention, 
and it's that at some point

00:05.160 --> 00:08.060
the river was flooding into the town,

00:08.160 --> 00:12.060
it seemed like it wanted to wash away the town.

00:12.060 --> 00:17.000
And someone came up with the idea to bring Santa Rosa, 
the niche, and place it outside.

00:17.320 --> 00:23.580
And the river started to recede, to move away from the town.

00:24.320 --> 00:31.580
Well, I can't just take that as fact, 
but Santa Rosa de Lima is highly cherished here in JordÃ¡n.
