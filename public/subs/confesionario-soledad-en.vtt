00:00.000 --> 00:04.500
During the campaign, there was indeed a lot of sexism,

00:04.500 --> 00:08.500
they believed that a woman couldn't handle power,

00:08.500 --> 00:14.500
that she couldn't be a councilwoman,
that maybe it was too much for her to be there.

00:14.500 --> 00:19.000
Even on the candidate list, there were very few women,

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
so, perhaps they saw little possibility 
for a woman to become a councilor.

00:24.000 --> 00:35.000
And at that time, I didn't have a current partner,
so one had to demand respect

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
and establish boundaries 
to prevent others from overstepping me.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
That was like the most difficult part, 
but everything else was fine.

00:45.500 --> 00:50.000
It's like a personal triumph to say

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
"I'm breaking free from that sexism, I won't take it anymore,"

00:55.000 --> 01:01.500
And change the way people think:
To think that something is impossible.

01:01.500 --> 01:11.500
In my personal life, I did experience some setbacks
where "I felt I couldn't go on anymore"

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
and being a single mother, 
I had to fight and support my children.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
So that was a... it gave me strength to say:

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
just because I'm a woman doesn't mean I can't do it.

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
Those things drive you, to grow as a person, as a woman,

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
and to set an example for other 
women who may feel they can't.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
one becomes an example that you can do it, 

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
if you want and work hard at it, 
things can be accomplished.
