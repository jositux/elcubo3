00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
When I went to work in the city of Bucaramanga, 
that's where I worked…

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
I arrived there a little inexperienced 
because it was the first time I had gone.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
I arrived at a family's house 
where there were four people.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
They received me well, the first day was fine, 
everything was good, 

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
But towards the end, like halfway through, 
it became more difficult because I had to prepare breakfast

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
for four people, but different breakfasts.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
And it had to be fast. They said: 
“look, this and that, and the other”

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
The cleaning was extensive, both downstairs and upstairs.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
There was a problem... not hanging clothes, that mine 
had to go somewhere else, that I couldn't hang them there.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
One day, the lady lost a ring and they 
blamed me for stealing it.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
And the other girl turned out to be the culprit.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
So I left because...

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
I went back home and left some clothes 
there because I thought I would return.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
When I arrived home, I said:  “I won't go back there anymore”.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
So, what did I do? My mom had to go to Bucaramanga to bring me the clothes that I had left there.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
I've never done that anymore, so I'd better go home so I won't be there and have no more problems.
