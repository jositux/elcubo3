00:00.000 --> 00:05.880
I was walking uphill that day when 
I encountered her, I was lying on a rock 

00:05.880 --> 00:09.840
resting with my suitcase 
and she appeared like this.

00:09.840 --> 00:13.000
I mean, a dress that touched the floor,

00:13.840 --> 00:17.000
a shining dress and the shoes,

00:17.640 --> 00:23.280
and that perfume that cannot be 
compared to any other perfume,

00:23.640 --> 00:28.280
and a bunch of ribbons around her waist,

00:28.280 --> 00:33.000
and she held a book in her hand,

00:33.280 --> 00:35.000
and the child, the child was here on this side,

00:35.240 --> 00:41.600
on the right side, she held his 
little hand and here was the bunch

00:41.600 --> 00:47.600
of ribbons that she carried, 
and she also carried the little hat,

00:47.600 --> 00:51.000
such a beautiful little hat the child had,

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
and the hair, the child's hair, was here, 
at the waist, so beautiful.

00:58.160 --> 01:01.560
And she spoke to me, but I... I wasn't able to,

01:03.560 --> 01:09.200
I wasn't able to hear what she said, 
so she made a sign to me.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.000
Further ahead, there were a few workers working,

01:11.680 --> 01:14.600
and she had to pass by where the workers were,

01:14.680 --> 01:19.000
and the workers didn't see her, and 
I was going up the little hill when I saw her,

01:19.000 --> 01:25.600
she was coming with the child, 
and that's the Virgin going over there,

01:25.600 --> 01:28.000
and further down, another boy encountered her,

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
further down, she had already 
passed by where the workers were,

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
and there was an old man, a grandfather, working,

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
he said: "I did see her... 
she had already passed by when I was working

01:41.000 --> 01:45.200
when I saw her, she walked towards the peak,

01:45.640 --> 01:48.200
and I said good afternoon to her,

01:48.200 --> 01:53.000
but I didn't know if she responded, 
she made a little gesture with her hand",

01:53.640 --> 02:01.000
and no one else saw her, not here in the 
town of Jordan, and she was coming to the town.
