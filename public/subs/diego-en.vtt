00:02.000 --> 00:08.000
I'm heading to my village, I'm happy to leave the town to fulfill my duty.

00:08.000 --> 00:16.000
♪I've sold my products that I've cultivated with effort, dedication, and the love of my children in my region♪

00:16.000 --> 00:25.000
Back in the hut, four children and my wife are waiting for me, along with an old woman who is my mother-in-law, accompanying my wife.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
When I go to town and get good prices, 
I become very happy and 
then I start to drink.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
My name is Diego Sarmiento González, from the municipality of Jordán Sube.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
My profession is music and agriculture.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
my uncles had to work harder than me.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
At that time, their father 
used to tell them:

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
"Go make noise somewhere else, 
you won't let us sleep, 
tomorrow we have to work."

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Hello, what are you doing?

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Sleeping already?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Yes.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
We are still rehearsing

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
Well, bye, see you in a bit.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
When I met my wife, I didn't pay attention to anything else, she said it was either her or music.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
I said to her: well, music, because I've carried music with me since I was a child.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
I'm afraid that time will pass and I won't do what I love.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Look, they just called me while we were talking about these things.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
The director of “Centro Vida” called me, she's new, I don't recognize her yet.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
And she said, "Are you Diego?"

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
I said, "Yes."

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
She said, "The thing is, we're going to have a little party."

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
So we want to invite you to bring the flavor, set the mood for them to dance and enjoy.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
She said: “I'll call you later…”

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
We'll call you again.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
I'll call you. Okay.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
It was for Thursday, tomorrow's Wednesday.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Tomorrow is Wednesday.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
She hasn't called me yet.

02:32.000 --> 02:39.000
Radio: The municipal administration and the San José de Jordán Sube parish

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
invite you to their patron saint festivities of Santa Rosa de Lima on August 29th and 30th,

02:46.000 --> 02:54.000
Monday 29th, 5:30 in the afternoon. Cultural event at Our Lady of Fatima School in Jordán Sube,

02:54.000 --> 03:02.000
12:00 noon, soccer game. 2:00 in the afternoon, music entertainment.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
5:00 in the afternoon, performance by the group "Bacardí".

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000 
[singing softly]

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
Nothing was arranged with the priest for the performance.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
- For today's show? 
- Well, yes…

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
We talked to the priest, but...
and he said yes, of course.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
I have no problem with 
it if he wants to, well...

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
Talk to the administration for a small budget for you guys, yes, yes, I know you need it.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
And we talked to the administration, but it wasn't possible.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
Nothing was arranged, we didn't reach an agreement, so we didn't have the opportunity to perform for that reason.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
People have asked me, all the people I've met, from Villanueva, from Aratoca, from Los Santos, from here...

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Are you going to play, 
are you not going to perform?

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
No, no, no...
There was no money.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
And well, people admire me here a lot, but one thing is the people, another thing is the administration.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
And when they have events, they bring groups from outside and don't consider us.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
No one is a prophet in their own land, right?

05:24.000 --> 05:32.000
So there's nothing to expect from the municipality, right? There's nothing to expect there.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
But anyway, what else can we do?

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
We have to move forward, as I say, move forward with our own things and maybe later on

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
they'll consider us, that's what I'm saying.

05:58.000 --> 06:05.000
I was given this contact for a studio, to record a little song I have.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
And I'm about to record it, so I needed...

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
What kind of music do you want to record?

06:15.000 --> 06:23.000
Carranguera music, carranga, typical music from here, from the region, yes, from here.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
Alright, alright. So if you want, let me make a quote and I'll send it to you.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
Alright, alright. I totally agree. This is my number, so I'll wait for your call to confirm.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Help me compose, man, right?

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
This happens with some little ladies.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
I've had another...

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
It's just that it hurts.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
It hurts, it doesn't hurt.

07:22.000 --> 07:28.000
This story happened to a friend of mine who had another and she pretended to be sick.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
It's almost full, why add more water?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
It's full.

07:33.000 --> 07:41.000
We'll have to add water later, if not tomorrow.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
It's just that it hurts, it hurts and it hurts.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Give me some money so I can go to the doctor.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
Do you like how you are?

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
Like all the songs, speaking badly about women.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Why speaking badly about women?

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
Well, I'm speaking badly because of women, but...But...

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
Even though those songs do that, they often speak the truth about women.

08:14.000 --> 08:20.000
Can't they compose for us men as well, and we won't get angry, why?

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
As a musician, sacrificing in life means often giving up on many things.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
Perhaps work, earning a living.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
Bringing home the bread because of being involved in music.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
Tobacco cultivation here in Jordán has given this region a lot of life.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
This little town was created when the Herraduras road existed.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
It still looks lonely now, just like...

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
Imagine in those times, there were very few people.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
You could pass without anyone noticing.

09:41.000 --> 09:47.000
I assure you, there were only about 3 residents around.

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
I need this, let's try to fix this bike quickly because I urgently need it.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
For the camel. To work.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
And I think these days it's going to Bucaramanga, man.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
I have to go to the song's place.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Let's see how... see if I can finish it... continue it.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Alright, my little son. 
That's settled.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Well, bye.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
And that's it, keep giving it your all.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
They say don't put off for tomorrow what you can do today.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
Yes.
Today I'm going to fulfill a dream of recording my first song.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
That really makes me proud.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
And thank God...

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
...today it became a reality.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Hello, what's up?

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
I'm here in Bucara, in the studio.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Ah, allright.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
This...

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
...is to let you know that 
I have to put it on airplane mode now,

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
to record and not receive calls.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
Ah, okay. Ah, alright.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Okay, my love. Bye.
We'll talk when I'm done here. Bye.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Out of tune?

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
No, just kidding.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
It's the second one, not the final one.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
That one!

12:46.000 --> 12:52.000
Better not show anything. Today we can't do anything about it, I can see that.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Song: This story happens to a girl

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
who had someone else and pretended to be sick.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
You sound sick to sing that crap.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Put some effort into it!

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
How are you feeling?


13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
Thirsty like a tequila, man. Then bring me three cans of guarapo, that day and you'll see!

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
And...

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
What?

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
We already recorded part of the song, the demo is done,

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
and now we're doing each instrument.

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
Well, we're with Carlitos, Carlitos and Don Fabio, the producer.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Oh, you're with Carlitos?

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
Yes, thank God Carlitos came, it was helpful that he came because

13:39.000 --> 13:49.000
it's always tough for me with little rehearsal, to have the song well rehearsed.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
And, what's for lunch?

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
My dream is to continue growing in music.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
And hopefully, I'll keep releasing songs, 

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
even if it's just, two songs a year, right?

14:15.000 --> 14:21.000
That would be really, really, really cool, very spectacular for me.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
Song: The poor horse is broke

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
And the great Lady left with no destination.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
The poor horse is broke.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
And the great Lady left with no destination...

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Give me some money, I'm going to the doctor.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
Give me some money, I'm going to the doctor.
