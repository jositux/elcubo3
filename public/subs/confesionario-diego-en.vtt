00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
There are several times when one 
is afraid of many things, right?

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
Like when many people say they are afraid to walk at night,

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
That is one part ... Because it scares you, right? 

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
But I am afraid of people, the living ones, not the dead, you know?

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
because the dead can not do anything, right?

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
I mean, in that sense, right?

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
And other things, well, if it's about work, 
if it's about looking at a business,

00:40.000 --> 00:48.000
an opportunity, then you have to look at things very carefully, 
if it serves you or not. That also scares you, right?

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
Fear in music, well, it's like people not liking

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
what one is doing, that scares you,

01:01.000 --> 01:08.000
that they won't like what one is doing, the music.
That's what scares me, right?

01:08.000 --> 01:17.000
That there may not be support, that they may not like the music, right?

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
When one feels fear, honestly, one sees as if the world

01:24.000 --> 01:35.000
is going to finish and not find any support or anything.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
That's the meaning of fear to me, right?

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Feeling fear, that one won't find support,

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
won't find someone to support or guide.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
one feels complexes.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Well, that's the meaning of fear for me, right?

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
It makes one feel insecure, sad, lazy,

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
but well, that's fear for me.
