There are several times when one is afraid of many things, right?

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
Like when many people say they are afraid to walk at night,

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
that's one aspect, right?

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Because it scares you, right? That thing.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
But I am afraid of people, the living ones, not the dead, you know?

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
Because the dead no longer do anything, right?

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
I mean, in that sense, right?

00:29.000 --> 00:40.000
And other things, well, if it's about work, if it's about looking at a business,

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
an opportunity, then you have to look at things very carefully,

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
if it serves you or not.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
That also scares you, right?

00:48.000 --> 00:57.000
Fear in music, well, it's like people not liking

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
what one is doing, that scares you,

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
that they won't like what one is doing, the music.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
That's what scares you, right?

01:08.000 --> 01:16.000
That there may not be support, that they may not like the music, right?

01:16.000 --> 01:24.000
When one feels fear, honestly, one sees as if the world

01:24.000 --> 01:35.000
is going to collapse and not find any support or anything.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
That's what I see fear as for me, right?

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Feeling fear, that one won't find support,

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
won't find someone to support or guide them.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
And one feels, well, complicated, you know?

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
But that's fear for me, right?

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
It makes one feel complex, sad, lazy,

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
but well, that's fear for me, right?
