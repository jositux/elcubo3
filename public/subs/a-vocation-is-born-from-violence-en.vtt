00:00.000 --> 00:06.720
In my community, in Mogotes, 
like in many communities in Colombia, we experienced 

00:06.720 --> 00:13.360
violence, no longer bipartisan, but from groups outside the law.

00:13.360 --> 00:19.000
First, there was a guerrilla attack 
where obviously there were deaths.

00:19.200 --> 00:24.000
I was eight years old at that time and 

00:24.200 --> 00:28.000
it had a profound impact on my life. The fear it generates,

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
the helplessness of finding oneself in such a situation

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
and not knowing why one is suffering at times.

00:38.000 --> 00:58.000
As in most of the Colombian countryside, in Jord√°n violence was experienced with great intensity, but not due to clashes between illegal armed groups, but rather due to the political dominance of a conservative family that established itself in power since the end of the decade of the 40's and exercised its control for more than 50 years.
