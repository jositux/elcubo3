00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
What my parents have told me is that the chieftains,

00:05.280 --> 00:10.880
who are the bosses, let's put it that way, the mayors, well,

00:10.880 --> 00:14.640
they didn't let the road through here, they say.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.640
They didn't want the road to go through here,

00:16.640 --> 00:18.960
but the line of the highway did pass through Jordan.
00:18.960 --> 00:20.880
Aratoca, JordÃ¡n, Mesa de los Santos.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.840
And it was a big mistake not to allow the road to pass through,

00:23.840 --> 00:28.160
they did not think about the future of people

00:28.240 --> 00:30.240
who lived here, right?

00:30.240 --> 00:33.120
They could have had a better future, right?

00:33.120 --> 00:34.720
And the lands, everything, 

00:34.720 --> 00:37.200
everything would have gained more value, more worth.

00:37.200 --> 00:40.240
The town would have been another colonial town,

00:40.240 --> 00:43.800
a town, let's say, similar to Barichaga, right?

00:43.800 --> 00:46.440
Barichara has a lot, in tourism, in everything.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.240
The value of the lands thereâ€¦

00:48.240 --> 00:51.120
a plot of land in Barichara is worth a lot of money.

00:51.120 --> 00:55.800
We have lost many things due to mismanagement

00:55.800 --> 00:59.080
due to the thinking of a person

00:59.080 --> 01:01.800
who often didn't have the right things in mind.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.080
Thinking about doing harm,

01:04.080 --> 01:06.600
but not thinking about doing good.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.600
And that's what happens, that's it.
