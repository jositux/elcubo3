We and Dad had to go sleep behind that hill,

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
on a big rock... for months and months.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Why?

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Because they would come to the houses and plunder

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
whatever was in the houses, the animals, the chickens, everything.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
Pigs, whatever they found, goats. They took them to eat.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
When they arrived at the houses, they set them on fire.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
And was it because you were against their party or something?

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
(Laughter)

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Yes?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
That's why, yes.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
You were... what, liberals?

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
I came and denied it. I came and denied it to him.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
One day he called me and said... why would I deny it?

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
I said, how can I? Am I going to tell you, are you also of that color?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Why...?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Is that your color... what, do you like it?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
I told him: look... some people like

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
what they like, they like it.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
My dad died and he didn't stop being.
