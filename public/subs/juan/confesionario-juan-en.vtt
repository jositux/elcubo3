Theology sheds light on human reality. In other words, theology is not a matter, I mean, it's not a matter of politics, or society, or anything like that, because it is the study of the mystery of God.

00:16.000 --> 00:32.000
Ultimately, that's it, right? Theos, which means God, and logia, well, yes, wisdom about God, the mystery of God, which is an unfathomable mystery, one will only learn something very minimal, yes.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
And there are things that it's better not to question too much because one won't find humanly speaking answers.

00:38.000 --> 01:03.000
But yes, through theology, human realities are illuminated. Those human realities are concrete realities that one encounters in the community, whether they are personal or communal within that context, or whether they are at a much broader level, which is a social level.

01:03.000 --> 01:23.000
So, in that line of thought, I believe that precisely Jesus also, his theology was not just to teach the disciples, you see, God is handsome, God is fat, God is skinny, God is cute, he never taught them that, never.

01:23.000 --> 01:35.000
The Gospel does not show us that, it does not show us that, the Gospel does not show us that. What does the person of Jesus show us? A constant action, illuminated from the mystery of God.

01:35.000 --> 01:56.000
We follow Jesus, not the ideology of Jesus, we follow Jesus who did a work, a mission that connected with the most marginalized of his time, children, women, he saw social realities, he saw injustice, he denounced it and all that.

01:56.000 --> 02:25.000
So, through that same channel, one also finds answers so that theology doesn't remain as something distant, I mean, something elevated, something that doesn't have a proper foundation, but it helps one to not let it just be a beautiful study, but to apply it, to apply it more to the context, in this specific case of Jordan.
