01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
I recognized her

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
I was about eight years old, 

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
and we used to play with her.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Eat, eat…

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
She's going to be my wife.
I told the other kids

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
And that turned out to be true, 
by fortune!

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Bye my love, be safe

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
And defend yourself from the goat

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
If the goat comes here,

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
run inside quickly, because the goat will attack you.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
As soon as you see it, 
Go inside and stay there. OK?

04:29.000 --> 04:36.000
Violence ended everything, 
ended with the town

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
All the environment, very pretty

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Beautiful houses, 
small but beautiful houses.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Good atmosphere,

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
When it all ended, 
It was the '48,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
it happened suddenly,

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
they exchanged gunfire and that hill

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
to this hill and there, from the cliff.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
And then the people, those who didn't die,

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
they left from here, to far away,

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
they left and went away, 
leaving their lands behind,

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
abandoned.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
Bullets from rifles are still found.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
over there in the cemetery the workers covered up 7 rifle hits

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Those are gunshots, even in the dead.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
There are still these crosses. 

05:51.000 --> 06:00.000
Here, this is the son of a certain "Patiño", that was killed there on that hill, they killed him.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
The man was killed, he was going to Bucaramanga, 

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
he was riding a horse daily, at that time there was no road, 

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
he was traveling with another gentleman

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Mr. Guillermo, come!

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
Why does Mrs. María always stay here alone?

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Because she can't see at night.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
Last night I gave her the food

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
she can't see where the food is anymore.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
No, she couldn't see.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
That's why after

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
it gets dark, I'm going to take her inside.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
So she can lay down and rest.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Why are you afraidof the camuro?

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
An animal like that hits one with a big blow.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
Only with what it has and takes you away.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
That crazy one over there in the town,

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
Have you seen him? He always walks with his hands like this. 

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Right, Lucho?

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
He's is that way because of a camuro That hit him

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Did it hit him?

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
Yes, he gave him a hit and knocked him down.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
The camuro that hit him

09:49.760 --> 09:58.520
Sometimes I talk to her, at night, and ask her if she remembers

09:59.520 --> 10:05.000
when she was about nine or ten years old, 
and if she remembers, 

10:05.520 --> 10:08.760
those were happy times

10:11.760 --> 10:15.840
but everything comes and passes and everything ends.

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
(Playing)

10:27.840 --> 10:30.000
She had seven surgeries on her head, 

10:30.840 --> 10:36.000
and that's why she lost her speech 
because they cut the brain tissues, 

10:36.960 --> 10:43.960
and then she couldn't speak. 
I told the doctor after I went to see her

10:43.960 --> 10:47.520
in the bed where she was, 
she spent four years there, 

10:47.960 --> 10:50.520
tired in the hospital, and I spent exactly four years there

10:50.520 --> 10:54.800
in the hospital with her, in Bucaramanga. 

10:54.520 --> 10:58.800
The attendants were going to take me out, no, I'm not leaving here because

10:59.800 --> 11:06.600
once I take my wife out, I'm going with her, 
they won't get me out of here. 

11:06.600 --> 11:12.120
They had shaved off all her hair, so I told a nurse,

11:12.120 --> 11:16.120
how is her hair going to grow back? 
She said, I have a shampoo

11:16.120 --> 11:22.240
I'm going to give her so they can apply it 

11:22.120 --> 11:27.240
on her little head every day, and her hair will grow back

11:27.240 --> 11:31.320
in eight days, new hair will start growing, you’ll see

11:49.600 --> 11:54.840
the main administration and the San Jose de Jordan Parish invite you to their patron saint festivities

11:54.840 --> 12:03.440
of Santa Rosa de Lima on August 29th and 30th, 
Monday 29th at 5 and 30 in the afternoon

12:03.440 --> 12:06.880
procession through the streets of Jordan 
at 6 and 15 in the afternoon

12:11.680 --> 12:16.000
when my wife got sick, I knelt and made a promise 

12:16.680 --> 12:22.000
and said Saint Rose the Miraculous, I know that you have great powers,

12:22.920 --> 12:29.720
I said, save my wife's life so that I can see her again. 

12:29.720 --> 12:32.240
Afterfour years lying in bed, 

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
and I saw her again when she got up

12:38.000 --> 12:46.960
now we are going to Santa Rosa, Santa Rosa de Lima

12:46.840 --> 12:54.000
I'll be right back, wait for me here

13:19.280 --> 13:22.000
in Colombian folk music because we are going

13:22.280 --> 13:26.560
to play them, who knows the title of this song?

14:56.440 --> 15:00.000
Tobacco spread and cracked

15:00.440 --> 15:02.440
Why didn't they pick it up?

15:06.440 --> 15:11.440
Go away. Go away because you're out.

15:50.440 --> 16:07.440
Happy Birthday to you, happy birthday Don Guillermo

16:11.440 --> 16:14.440
Thank you. Sit down to bring you a piece of cake.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.440
God bless you. May you have many more years.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.440
Well, thank you, doctor. Very kind.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.440
Let's congratulate the quinceañero 
(a person celebrating their fifteenth birthday).

16:22.440 --> 16:25.440
I love you, God.

16:25.440 --> 16:33.440
Thank you for the health, life, 
and understanding you give us.

16:33.440 --> 16:39.440
I ask the Lord every day to take care of you and protect you.

16:39.440 --> 16:43.440
She is the only one who accompanies me in the house.

16:44.440 --> 16:50.440
And that's what I have to give Thanks to God, she is doing well.


16:50.440 --> 16:56.440
Because many people say, "Oh, those two fools 
over there in the house, what are they doing?"

17:00.440 --> 17:05.440
I love her until the very last day I live in this world.

17:08.440 --> 17:12.440
If I die before her.

17:13.440 --> 17:17.440
Then it's God's will that takes me.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.440
That’s the only way I leave her

17:28.440 --> 17:32.440
But in glory, we will meet again.
