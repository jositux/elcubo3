01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
I recognized her

01:39.000 --> 01:48.000
I arrived, like me, about eight years old, and we used to play with her.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
What? What do you mean, like you, her? Are you going to leave me out?

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
I said, she's going to be my wife.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
I told the other kids.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
She's going to be my wife.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
And that turned out to be true fortune.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Let's go!

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Let's go!

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
How should I go?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Don't worry, I'll handle it, food.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Don't go.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Then you said no.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
And you gave up on the fight, right?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
If the fight comes here,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
run inside the race track

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
because the fight will attack you.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Stay calm,

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
and now the guard is coming in.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
OK?

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
I arrived, like me, about eight years old, and we used to play with her.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
What? What do you mean, like you, her? Are you going to leave me out?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I said, she's going to be my wife.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
What? What do you mean, like you, her? Are you going to leave me out?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
If the fight comes here,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
run inside the race track

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
because the fight will attack you.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Stay calm,

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
and now the guard is coming in.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
and now the guard is coming in.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
The whole atmosphere there,

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
very beautiful.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Beautiful houses,

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
small but beautiful houses.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Good atmosphere,

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
but then it all ended,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
It was in '48,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
It was in '48,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
to end it was in '48,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
it happened suddenly,

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
they exchanged gunfire and that hill

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
to this hill and there, from the cliff.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
And then the people, those who didn't die,

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
they left from here,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
to far away,

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
they left and went away,

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
leaving their lands behind,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
abandoned.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Bullets from the proletarians of Juzil

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
are still found.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Bullets from the proletarians of Juzil

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
are still found.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
It's not just there in the cemetery

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
where the teachers were found,

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
seven shots,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
it's from the dead there.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
It's not just there in the cemetery

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
where the teachers were found,

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
seven shots,

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
it's from the dead there.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
It's not just there in the cemetery

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
where the teachers were found,

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
seven shots,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
it's from the dead there.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Come, with a very dim light.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Why does Mrs. María

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
always stay here alone?

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Because she can't see at night.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
We're already following the night.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I saw that food,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
she can't see where the food is anymore.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
No, she couldn't see.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
That's why after

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
she gets dark,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I'm going to take her

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
inside.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
So she can come back.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Why are you afraid

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
of the camuros?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
One leaves the other

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
and hits one with a big blow.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Just knocks them down

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
and takes them away.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
That crazy one over there

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
in the town,

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
everyone has seen him.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
He walks with his hands like this.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
He's the one who satisfies a camuro.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Did he get him?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Yes, he gave him a hit

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
and knocked him down.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
He's an eight-point camuro.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
What's that?

09:42.760 --> 09:59.520
Sometimes I remember with voices, with them, and at night I tell her if she remembers

09:59.520 --> 10:08.760
when she was about nine or ten years old, and if she remembers, those were happy times

10:08.760 --> 10:19.840
but everything is fine and everything passes, it ends, it fades away, it's cut

10:19.840 --> 10:34.960
She had seven surgeries on her head, and that's why she lost her speech because they cut

10:34.960 --> 10:43.960
the brain tissues, and then she couldn't speak. I told the doctor after I went to see her

10:43.960 --> 10:50.520
in the bed where she was, she spent four years there, lying in the hospital, and I spent exactly four years there

10:50.520 --> 10:59.800
in the hospital with her, Bucaramanga. The attendants were going to take me out, no, I'm not leaving here because

10:59.800 --> 11:08.600
once I take my wife out, I'm going with her, they won't get me out of here for anything else. They had shaved off all her hair

11:08.600 --> 11:16.120
so I told a nurse, how is her hair going to grow back? She said, I have a shampoo

11:16.120 --> 11:26.240
I'm going to give her so they can apply it on her little head every day, and her hair will grow back

11:26.240 --> 11:30.320
in eight days while they're doing her hair

11:38.600 --> 11:54.840
the main administration and the San Jose de Jordan Parish invite you to their patron saint festivities

11:54.840 --> 12

:03.440
of Santa Rosa de Lima on August 29th and 30th, Monday 29th at 5 and 30 in the afternoon

12:03.440 --> 12:06.880
procession through the streets of Jordan at 6 and 15 in the afternoon

12:11.680 --> 12:19.920
when the woman got sick, I made a promise to Saint Roch and Saint Rose the Miraculous, I know that you

12:19.920 --> 12:29.720
have great powers, I said, save my wife's life so that I can see her again after

12:29.720 --> 12:37.240
four years lying in bed, and I saw her again when she got up

12:38.520 --> 12:44.960
now we are going to Santa Rosa, Santa Rosa de Lima

12:46.840 --> 12:48.000
I'll be right back

12:50.240 --> 12:52.320
wait for me here

12:59.720 --> 13:02.600
and

Here is the translation of the text you provided:

13:08.600 --> 13:09.600
and

13:19.280 --> 13:25.560
in Colombian folk music because we are going to play them, who knows the title

13:30.000 --> 13:30.700
no

13:45.600 --> 13:47.220
I did that

13:59.720 --> 14:27.320
let's see

14:27.320 --> 14:29.540
let's see

14:52.960 --> 14:54.440
this is traffic

14:54.440 --> 14:59.440
Tobacco, gift, and I leave.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.440
Why didn't they cover it?

15:06.440 --> 15:11.440
Go away. Go away because you're out.

15:18.440 --> 15:20.440
This stayed here.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.440
Go away.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.440
Go away.

15:28.440 --> 15:30.440
Go away.

15:58.440 --> 16:07.440
Birthday with Guillermo. Birthday with Guillermo.

16:11.440 --> 16:14.440
Thank you. Sit down to bring him your dessert.

16:14.440 --> 16:15.440
God bless me.

16:15.440 --> 16:17.440
May you have many more years.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.440
Well, thank you, doctor. Very kind.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.440
Let's congratulate the quinceañero (a person celebrating their fifteenth birthday).

16:22.440 --> 16:25.440
I love you, God.

16:25.440 --> 16:33.440
Thank you for the health, life, and understanding you give us.

16:33.440 --> 16:39.440
I ask the Lord every day to take care of me and protect me.

16:39.440 --> 16:43.440
She is the only one who accompanies me in prison.

16:43.440 --> 16:46.440
And that's what I have to give them.

16:46.440 --> 16:50.440
Thank God that she is doing well.

16:50.440 --> 16:55.440
Because many people say, "Oh, those two fools over there in the house, what are they doing?"

17:00.440 --> 17:04.440
I love her until the last day I live in this world.

17:08.440 --> 17:12.440
If I die, it will be before her.

17:13.440 --> 17:17.440
Then it's God's will that takes me.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.440
Then I have to leave her.

17:28.440 --> 17:32.440
But in glory, we will meet again.
