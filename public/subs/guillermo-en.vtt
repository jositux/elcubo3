01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
I recognized her

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
I was about eight years old, 

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
and we used to play with her.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Eat, eat…

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
I told the other kids:

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
She's going to be my wife.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
And that turned out to be true, by fortune!

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Bye my love, be safe

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
And defend yourself from the goat

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
If the goat comes here,

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
run inside quickly

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
because the goat will attack you.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
As soon as you see it

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Go inside and stay there.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
OK?


04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Violence ended everything, ended with the town

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
All the environment

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Everything very pretty

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Beautiful houses

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
small but beautiful houses.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Good atmosphere,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
When it all ended,

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
It was the '48,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
it happened suddenly,

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
they exchanged gunfire and that hill

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
to this hill and there, from the cliff.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
And then the people, those who didn't die,

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
they left from here,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
to far away,

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
they left and went away,

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
leaving their lands behind,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
abandoned.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
Bullets from rifles.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
are still found.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
over there in the cemetery

05:41.000 --> 05:41.000
the workers covered up 

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
7 rifle hits

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Those are gunshots, even in the dead.


05:47.000 --> 06:49.000
There are still these crosses. 

05:51.000 --> 06:00.000
Here, this is the son of a certain "Patiño", that was killed there on that hill, they killed him.

06:00.000 --> 06:13.000
The man was killed, he was going to Bucaramanga, he was riding a horse daily, at that time there was no road, he was traveling with another gentleman

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Mr. Guillermo, come!

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Why does Mrs. María

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
always stay here alone?

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Because she can't see at night.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Last night
06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I gave her the food

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
she can't see where the food is anymore.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
No, she couldn't see.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
That's why after

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
it gets dark,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I'm going to take her

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
inside.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
So she can lay down and rest.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Why are you afraidof the camuro?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
An animal like that

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
hits one with a big blow.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Only with what it has

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
and takes you away.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
That crazy one over there

07:16.000 --> 07:16.000
in the town,

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Have you seen him?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
He always walks with his hands like this. 

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Right, Lucho?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
He's is that way because of a camuro

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
That hit him

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Did it hit him?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Yes, he gave him a hit

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
and knocked him down.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
The camuro that hit him

07:49.000 --> 07:58.000
What's that?


09:49.760 --> 09:58.520
Sometimes I talk to her, at night, and ask her if she remembers

09:59.520 --> 10:08.760
when she was about nine or ten years old, and if she remembers, those were happy times


10:11.760 --> 10:13.840
but everything comes and passes and everything ends.

10:27.840 --> 10:34.960
She had seven surgeries on her head, and that's why she lost her speech because they cut

10:34.960 --> 10:43.960
the brain tissues, and then she couldn't speak. I told the doctor after I went to see her

10:43.960 --> 10:50.520
in the bed where she was, she spent four years there, lying in the hospital, and I spent exactly four years there

10:50.520 --> 10:59.800
in the hospital with her, in Bucaramanga. The attendants were going to take me out, no, I'm not leaving here because

10:59.800 --> 11:08.600
once I take my wife out, I'm going with her, they won't get me out of here. They had shaved off all her hair

11:08.600 --> 11:16.120
so I told a nurse, how is her hair going to grow back? She said, I have a shampoo

11:16.120 --> 11:26.240
I'm going to give her so they can apply it on her little head every day, and her hair will grow back

11:26.240 --> 11:30.320
in eight days, new hair will start growing, you’ll see

11:49.600 --> 11:54.840
the main administration and the San Jose de Jordan Parish invite you to their patron saint festivities

11:54.840 --> 12:03.440
of Santa Rosa de Lima on August 29th and 30th, Monday 29th at 5 and 30 in the afternoon

12:03.440 --> 12:06.880
procession through the streets of Jordan at 6 and 15 in the afternoon

12:11.680 --> 12:19.920
when my wife got sick, I knelt and made a promise and said Saint Rose the Miraculous, I know that you

12:19.920 --> 12:29.720
have great powers, I said, save my wife's life so that I can see her again. After

12:29.720 --> 12:37.240
four years lying in bed, and I saw her again when she got up


12:38.520 --> 12:44.960
now we are going to Santa Rosa, Santa Rosa de Lima

12:46.840 --> 12:48.000
I'll be right back

12:50.240 --> 12:52.320
wait for me here


13:19.280 --> 13:25.560
in Colombian folk music because we are going to play them, who knows the title of this song?

14:56.440 --> 14:59.440
Tobacco spread and cracked

15:00.440 --> 15:02.440
Why didn't they pick it up?

15:06.440 --> 15:11.440
Go away. Go away because you're out.

15:58.440 --> 16:07.440
Happy Birthday to you, happy birthday Don Guillermo

16:11.440 --> 16:14.440
Thank you. Sit down to bring you a piece of cake.

16:14.440 --> 16:15.440
God bless you

16:15.440 --> 16:17.440
May you have many more years.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.440
Well, thank you, doctor. Very kind.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.440
Let's congratulate the quinceañero (a person celebrating their fifteenth birthday).

16:22.440 --> 16:25.440
I love you, God.

16:25.440 --> 16:33.440
Thank you for the health, life, and understanding you give us.

16:33.440 --> 16:39.440
I ask the Lord every day to take care of you and protect you.

16:39.440 --> 16:43.440
She is the only one who accompanies me in the house.

16:43.440 --> 16:46.440
And that's what I have to give

16:46.440 --> 16:50.440
Thanks to God, she is doing well.

16:50.440 --> 16:55.440
Because many people say, "Oh, those two fools over there in the house, what are they doing?"

17:00.440 --> 17:04.440
I love her until the very last day I live in this world.

17:08.440 --> 17:12.440
If I die before her.

17:13.440 --> 17:17.440
Then it's God's will that takes me.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.440
That’s the only way I leave her

17:28.440 --> 17:32.440
But in glory, we will meet again.
