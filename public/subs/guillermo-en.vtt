WEBVTT

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
I recognized her

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
I was about eight years old, 

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
and we used to play with her.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Eat, eat…

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
I told the other kids: “She's going to be my wife”.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
And that turned out to be true!

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Bye my love, be safe

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
and defend yourself from the goat.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
If the goat comes here,

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
go inside quickly because the goat could attack you.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
As soon as you see it, go inside and stay there, ok?

04:29.000 --> 04:36.000
Violence ended everything, ended with the town

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
All the good atmosphere. Everything was pretty.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Beautiful houses, 
small but beautiful houses.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Good atmosphere.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
When it all ended, It was the '48,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
it happened suddenly,

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
they exchanged gunfire from that hill

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
to this hill and there, from the cliff.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
And then the people, those who didn't die,

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
they left from here, to far away,

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
they left and went away, leaving their lands behind,

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
abandoned.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
Bullets from rifles are still found.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
over there in the cemetery, 
the workers covered up 7 rifle hits.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
There are gunshots, even in the dead.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
There are still these crosses. 

05:51.000 --> 06:00.000
Here, this one is from a certain "Patiño", 
who was killed there, on that hill. They killed him.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
The man was killed when he was going to Bucaramanga,

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
he was riding a horse daily, 
at that time there was no road, 

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
he was traveling with another gentleman...

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
- Don Guillermo, come a minute!

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
- Why does Mrs. María always stay here alone?

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
- Because she can't see. Last night...
Last night I gave her the food,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
and she couldn’t see where the food was.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
No, she couldn't see.

06:54.000 --> 07:01.000
That's why after it gets dark, I take her inside.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
-So she can lay down and rest.
- Yes.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
- Why are you afraid of the goat ?

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
An animal like that can hit you with a big blow

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
and then take you away.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
That crazy man over there in the town,

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
Have you seen him? He always 
walks with his hands like this. 

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
- Oh yes, Lucho?

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
He's is that way because of a camuro (goat) that hit him.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
- Did it hit him?

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
- Yes, he gave him a hit and knocked him down.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
The “camuro” (goat) that hit him. 

09:49.760 --> 09:59.520
Sometimes I talk to her, at night, 
and ask her if she remembers

09:59.520 --> 10:05.000
when she was about nine or ten years old, 
and if she remembers, 

10:05.520 --> 10:09.760
those were happy times

10:11.760 --> 10:15.840
but everything comes and passes and everything ends.

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
(Playing)

10:27.840 --> 10:30.000
She had seven surgeries on her head, 

10:30.840 --> 10:36.000
and that's why she lost her speech 
because they cut the brain tissues, 

10:36.960 --> 10:43.960
and then she couldn't speak. I went to see her,

10:43.960 --> 10:47.520
in the bed where she was, she spent four years there, 

10:47.960 --> 10:50.520
lying in a hospital bed, and I spent exactly four years there,

10:50.520 --> 10:54.800
in the hospital with her, in Bucaramanga. 

10:54.800 --> 10:59.800
Nurses wanted to take me out. No, I'm not leaving here because

10:59.800 --> 11:06.600
once I take my wife out, I'm going with her, 
they won't take me out of here. 

11:06.600 --> 11:12.120
They had shaved her entire head so I asked a nurse: 

11:12.120 --> 11:16.120
“how is her hair going to grow back?”  
She said:  “I have a shampoo,

11:16.120 --> 11:22.240
I'm going to give you one so you can apply it

11:22.240 --> 11:27.240
on her little head every day, and her hair will grow back

11:27.240 --> 11:32.320
in eight days, new hair will start growing, you’ll see”.

11:49.600 --> 11:54.840
Announcer: the main administration and the San Jose de Jordan 
Parish invite you to their patron saint festivities

11:54.840 --> 12:03.440
of Santa Rosa de Lima on August 29th and 30th. 
Monday 29th at 5:30 PM

12:03.440 --> 12:06.880
procession through the streets of Jordan at 6:15 PM...

12:11.680 --> 12:16.680
When my wife got sick, I knelt and made a promise

12:16.680 --> 12:22.920
and said Saint Rose the Miraculous, 
I know that you have great powers,

12:22.920 --> 12:29.720
I said, save my wife's life so that I can see her again. 

12:29.720 --> 12:33.240
After spending four years in a hospital bed, 

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
I saw her again when she got up.

12:38.000 --> 12:46.960
I'm going to Santa Rosa, Santa Rosa de Lima

12:46.960 --> 12:54.000
I'll be right back, wait for me here. Ok?

13:19.280 --> 13:22.000
…in traditional Colombian music because we are going

13:22.280 --> 13:26.560
to play them.  Who knows the title of this song?

14:56.440 --> 15:00.000
Tobacco spread and cracked

15:00.440 --> 15:02.440
Why didn't they pick it up?

15:06.440 --> 15:11.440
Go away. Go away because you're out.

15:50.440 --> 16:07.440
<i>♪ Happy Birthday to you, happy birthday Don Guillermo ♪</i>

16:11.440 --> 16:14.440
- Sit down to bring you a piece of cake.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.440
God bless you. May you have many more years.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.440
- Well, thank you, doctor. Very kind.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.440
Let's congratulate the “quinceañero” 
(a person celebrating their fifteenth birthday).

16:22.440 --> 16:25.440
I love you God.

16:25.440 --> 16:33.440
Thank you for the health, life, 
and understanding you give us.

16:33.440 --> 16:39.440
I ask the Lord every day to 
take care of her and protect her.

16:39.440 --> 16:43.440
She is the only one who accompanies me in the house.

16:44.440 --> 16:50.440
And that's what I have to give 
thanks to God, she is doing well.

16:50.440 --> 16:56.440
Because many people say, "Oh, those two alone 
over there in the house, what do they do?"

17:00.440 --> 17:05.440
I'll love her until the very last day 
I live in this world.

17:08.440 --> 17:12.440
If I die before her,

17:13.440 --> 17:17.440
then it's God's will that takes me.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.440
That’s the only way I leave her.

17:28.440 --> 17:32.440
But in glory, we will meet again.
